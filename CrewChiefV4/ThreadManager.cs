/*
 * This class' responsibility is to provide corrdination around creation and destruction of threads in CC.  Here's proposal for strategy of
 * dealing with threads in CC, aka "Architecture":
 * 
 * If any of the threads creates a thread, ideally it has to wait for a child thread to exit when parent thread exits.  Another alternative is
 * strict locking of shared resources.  However, waiting and locking is not always practical.  ThreadManager class is intended to
 * help Start/Stop/Shutdown of CC to be predictable and clean by allowing threads to be registered and waited on at Start/Stop/Shutdown.
 * This avoids unpredictable crashes/exceptions while accessing resources no longer available.
 * 
 * 1. There are three categories of threads in CC:
 * 
 *      - Root threads: generally started from UI thread on Start button click, and stopped on Stop button click.
 *        Each root thread has to be named and registered with ThreadManager.RegisterRootThread.
 * 
 *      - Temporary threads: various short-lived/helper threads.  For example, wait for speech, or waiting for something to happen.
 *        Generally, started by Root threads or their children.
 *        
 *        If a parent thread does not wait for a temporary thread on termination, temporary thread has to named and be registered
 *        with ThreadManager.RegisterTemporaryThread.  Additionally, when a new instance of temporary thread is created,
 *        ThreadManager.UnregisterTemporaryThread has to be called on previous one.  See existing code on how to do this.
 * 
 *      - Resource threads: sound loading, caching, downloading etc.  Those threads are generally independent threads that can run without
 *        CC root threads running.  Each resource thread has to be named and registered with ThreadManager.RegisterResourceThread.
 *
 * 3. Each thread should release/dispose it's resources on exit, unless it is too complicated/unpractical (See GlobalResources class)
 * 
 * 4. Global shared resources will be released after form close (and all threads stopped, if they stop within agreed time,
 *    otherwise - undefined behavior).
 * 
 * 5. Access to the main window should be synchronized with MainWindow.instanceLock.  Be extra careful, if you are marshalling to the main thread,
 *    do a Post, not Send, so that lock is not held.  Failing to follow above might cause deadlocks.
 * 
 * 6. For Sleeps longer than 2 seconds, consider using Utilities.InterruptedSleep to avoid Shutdown/Stop delays.
 * 
 * 7. For worker threads that pump some data, don't just use Sleep, use Events to wake them up.
