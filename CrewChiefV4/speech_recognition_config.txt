# this is a comment - any blank line or line starting with # is ignored

# This file contains default options and mappings for the speech recogniser, ***** and will be overwritten when the app is updated *****.
#
# The mappings in here can be overridden by creating another file called "speech_recognition_config.txt" and placing this in 
# [user]/AppData/local/CrewChiefV4/
#
# Any mappings in that file will replace the corresponding default here - note that they won't be added, they're be replaced. 
# So if you create this file with a single line: 
# HOWS_MY_TYRE_WEAR = tire wear
# the existing mappings for HOWS_MY_TYRE_WEAR will be removed, so the app will only recognise this new phrase.
# You only need to add mappings when you want to override the default - the app will gather up the defaults first,
# and replace any which are also in the override file.

# Each option is separated by a colon, so if you want the app to tell you the air temp, you can ask

# WHATS_THE_AIR_TEMP = ow 'ot is it:is it cowd:nice out:tell me the air temp or else

# or you can just have a single phrase:
# WHATS_THE_AIR_TEMP = whats the air temp
