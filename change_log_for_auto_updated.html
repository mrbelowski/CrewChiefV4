<h2>Version 4.3.0.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Initial (beta) support for rFactor 1/Automobilista/Stock Car Extreme. Download 'rFactorSharedMemoryMap.dll' from <a href='https://github.com/dallongo/rFactorSharedMemoryMap/releases/latest'>https://github.com/dallongo/rFactorSharedMemoryMap/releases/latest</a> and place it in the sim's Plugin folder, then select 'rFactor' in Crew Chief.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.8</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Include more laps in the opponent vs player laptime comparisons during race sessions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use lastSectorTime and lapInvalidated data for opponent cars when in PCars UDP (network data) mode. This makes the opponent lap time reports accurate as the app doesn't have to time them itself (this data isn't available in PCars shared memory data). I recommend using UDP mode for PCars on PC, rather than shared memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed PCars practice and qual session data being cleared when pitting (should fix a lot of the inaccuracies in these sessions)</li>
	<li>Pause messages after a "stand by" response</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Raceroom WTCC 2014 tyre heating thresholds</li>
</ul>

	<li>Fixed 'what time is is' voice command (thanks Gongo)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added more logging around UDP packet reception and processing</li>
	<li>Fixed a couple of memory leaks</li>
	<li>Don't play 'no tyre wear' after changing tyres</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug in the gap-ahead logic that was triggering 'keep him under pressure' messages too often</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for secondary driver names mappings file 'additional_names.txt' so the auto-updater doesn't overwrite user-made changes to names.txt</li>
	<li>Additional validation on R3E sector reports</li>
	<li>Added "what's the fastest lap" and "what time is it" voice commands (reports session best lap for player class, and current [real world] time of day)</li>
	<li>A few bug fixes and minor improvements</li>
	<li>Reworked R3E tyre temperature checking to make better use of the core temps provided by the game (for new physics model cars)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.0.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added ADAC 2015 and F4 RaceRoom classes</li>
	<li>PCars suspension damage threshold tweak</li>
	<li>Damage reporting rework</li>
	<li>Various bug fixes and minor improvements</li>
	<li>Don't play fuel messages while being refuelled</li>

	<li>Fixed best lap and brake damage voice commands</li>
	<li>More frequent opponent gap reports on longer tracks</li>
	<li>Added brake and tyre temp warning on pit exit (when temps aren't optimal) - these are optional (brake temp warning is on by default, tyre temp warning is off)</li>
	<li>Some voice commands now trigger a "stand by" response, then a few seconds later the actual response (optional, enabled by default - uses "enable_delayed_responses" property)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.6.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added Raceroom Formula Junior class</li>
	<li>Tweaked Raceroom engine damage thresholds</li>
</ul>

</ul>

	<li>Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More pit window logic fixes for PCars</li>
	<li>Don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the race is a fixed time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed 'box this lap' calls being made when there is no mandatory stop, when running PCars in UDP mode</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed some speech recogniser / button handling issues - "Toggle" mode is now renamed "Press and release button" and actually works</li>

	<li>Don't play a message twice in succession if a player asks for something that the app was going to tell them anyway</li>
	<li>Don't play good / OK start messages if the player has picked up a penalty (i.e. false start)</li>
	<li>Insert a short pause between some messages</li>
	<li>Reduce the likelihood of multiple sweary messages being played in quick succession</li>
