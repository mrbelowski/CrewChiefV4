</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4.0.1</h2>

</ul>

	<li>Some voice commands now trigger a "stand by" response, then a few seconds later the actual response (optional, enabled by default - uses "enable_delayed_responses" property)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.6.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added Raceroom Formula Junior class</li>
	<li>Tweaked Raceroom engine damage thresholds</li>

	<li>Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More pit window logic fixes for PCars</li>
	<li>Don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the race is a fixed time</li>
