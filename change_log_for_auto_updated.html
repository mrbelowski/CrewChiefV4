<h2>Version 4.6.7.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Overhauled internal sound handling to make the app behave better</li>
	<li>Use game-provided mandatory pitstop data where available (should fix app thinking you've completed your mandatory pitstop when the game thinks otherwise)</li>
	<li>Some more car and track mappings</li>
	<li>Added 'three wide you're on the left' and 'three wide you're on the right' to the spotter</li>
	<li>Added voice command "where am I faster" / "where can I attack" and "where am I slower" / "where should I defend"</li>
	<li>Mapped Watkins Glen for PCars/li>
	<li>A few bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.6.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added fuel use per lap response ("what's my fuel usage" / "what's my fuel consumption" / "what's my fuel use")</li>
	<li>Faster start up times</li>
	<li>Better CPU usage</li>
	<li>Some internal fixes</li>
	<li>more of Scoop's corner mappings (recordings still to be done)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.6.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some RFactor and RFactor2 issues</li>
	<li>Added a few more track location mappings (thanks again Scoops)</li>
	<li>Disabled 'incident ahead' in R3E while I resolve the false-positives</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.6.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added a big set of corner name and location data thanks to Scoops' hard work</li>
	<li>Overhauled yellow flag logic for sector yellows and local yellows</li>
	<li>Read times accurate to hundredths of a second in some circumstances</li>
	<li>Added oval-specific behaviours (enabled per-track with a flag in trackLandmarks.json) - ignores brake and left side tyre temps, estimates tyre wear from right side tyres only</li>
	<li>Added an experimental 'realistic mode' option - enabling this supresses some messages based on car class and track (e.g. spotter is off at start of session when not on ovals, older car classes have less telemetry based info like tyre temps) - this is very much 'work in progress'; added per-car class behaviours for yellow flag phrasing (e.g. pace car vs safety car) and last lap message (e.g. "white flag" for last lap only applies to Indy and NASCAR cars)</li>
	<li>Added 'force update check' button</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.5.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed AC plugin after 1.14 update</li>

<ul>
	<li>Automatically switch between yellow and blue flag implementations in R3E depending on whether flag rules are enabled in-game</li>
	<li>Added some more incident calling and yellow flag options</li>
	<li>Added button mapping and voice command to suspend and enable yellow flag messages - enable with "give me yellows", "tell me yellows", "give me incident updates" or "give me yellow flag updates". Disable with "no more yellows", "stop incident updates", "don't give me yellows" or "don't tell me yellows"</li>
	<li>Fixed the "where is Bob?" voice message response in qual and practice sessions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.4.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added R3E Mantorp Park (long), Norisring and Sachsenring corner data</li>
	<li>A bit more R3E flag tweaking</li>
</ul>

	<li>Made opponent incident detection less sensitive and added an option to disable it (enable_simple_incident_detection)</li>
	<li>Reworked opponent lap and sector handling to fix incorrect sector time and pace reports (all games)</li>

<ul>
	<li>Fix crash bug in PCars with UDP data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.4.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added installer for game specific plugins (AC, AMS / RF1 and RF2) - the app now offers to copy the required plugin files to the games' install directory if they're missing or out of date</li>
	<li>extended incident reporting logic and sounds to allow for multiple involved drivers to be reported (if we have the driver name sounds) or 'pileup' warning if 4 or more drivers are stopped in the same corner</li>

	<li>Revised RF2 and AMS opponent data handling to fix missing gap messages</li>
	<li>More work on AMS session end bugs</li>
	<li>Added better reporting of yellow flags for AMS and RF2 - the app will sometimes tell you who's involved in the incident and what corner the incident is in</li>
	<li>Added simple incident reporting for known corners in R3E, AC and PCars</li>
	<li>Added attack / defend calls for known corners (note these messages don't play often - this is intentional)</li>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed broken settings preventing changes to any setting from being saved</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.1.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Integrated personalisations - the app will ask you to download a new "Personalisations" sound pack. When this is complete the "My name" drop down box (top right) has a long list of names the app can use when addressing you. This replaces the old method of manually unpacking a prefixes_and_suffixes folder to the app's sounds</li>
	<li>Work-around for Assetto Corsa sometimes giving out of date position information</li>
	<li>Disable multi-class code for RF1 based games because the vehicle type data from Automobilista is too vague (things like "Ford" and "Peugeot")</li>
	<li>Ported RF2 full course yellow and sector-specific yellow flag announcements to Automobilista</li>
	<li>Removed irrelvant pit window messages from RF1 based sims - in offline sessions, if a pit schedule is defined the app will call "box now" in accordance with this schedule (assuming equal stint lengths) - this can be disabled with enable_ams_pit_schedule_messages property</li>
	<li>Fixed cut track warnings playing on out laps in Automobilista</li>

	<li>Scan for controllers only on request (press the "Scan for controllers" button to update the app's list of controllers) - this also improves the app's startup time</li>
	<li>Fixed Assetto Corsa missing race start after 1.12 patch</li>
	<li>Added chequered flag message for timed sessions (still some issues here with PCars)</li>
	<li>Reworked PCars session end detection; added controller bindings for message volume up / down</li>
	<li>Added some simple help text (much much more needs to be added to this)</li>

	<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.5.0.0</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed some issues with pre-lights messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4.2.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reworked pre-lights message logic (optional) - app will play race session messages while you're on the grid until the throttle / brake / clutch is pressed, then it'll play the 'get ready' message. This can be enabled by selecting 'play_pre_lights_messages_until_cancelled' option on the Properties screen</li>
	<li>Some driver name mapping fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4.1.3</h2>

	<li>Fixed best lap and brake damage voice commands</li>
	<li>More frequent opponent gap reports on longer tracks</li>
	<li>Added brake and tyre temp warning on pit exit (when temps aren't optimal) - these are optional (brake temp warning is on by default, tyre temp warning is off)</li>
	<li>Some voice commands now trigger a "stand by" response, then a few seconds later the actual response (optional, enabled by default - uses "enable_delayed_responses" property)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.6.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added Raceroom Formula Junior class</li>
	<li>Tweaked Raceroom engine damage thresholds</li>

<h2>Version 4.1.4.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Disable PCars pit window messages by default (can be re-enabled with the enable_pcars_pit_window_messages setting) - this only works correctly in offline races</li>
	<li>Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More pit window logic fixes for PCars</li>
	<li>Don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the race is a fixed time</li>
