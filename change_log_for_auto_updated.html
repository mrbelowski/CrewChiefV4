<h2>Version 4.9.1.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More detailed error messages</li>
	<li>pCars and pCars2 performance improvements</li>
	<li>iRacing performance improvements</li>
	<li>AC fixes for shorter tracks (2 sectors)</li>
	<li>Fixed inaccurate race position messages in iRacing 'checkered flag' phase</li>
	<li>Some iRacing stability improvements</li>
	<li>Use relative lap time difference when working out when to give multi-class warnings. This uses 2 new Properties - 'Multi-class slower car warning time' and 'Multi-class faster car warning time' - this is the approximate average amount of notice you want the app to give you when approaching a different class car</li>
	<li>Added iRacing voice commands to get out of car ('get out') and get the average SoF ('what's the sof' / 'what is the strength of field')</li>
	<li>For Assetto Corsa, only allow multi-class races if the number of unknown car models is less than property 'Max unknown car models in ACS multi-class races' (default 0) - this is necessary because Assetto doesn't expose proper class data. This prevents the app dividing participants into different classes unless the app recognises all the car models in the session</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.1.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Workaround for iRacing opponent pitting message spam</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.1.3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Minor multi-class tweaks</li>
	<li>Assume single class if most car classes in a race are unknown to the app (AC, rF2 and rF1 only)</li>
	<li>Added button to save console output to a file (in Documents/ CrewChiefV4/debug/)</li>
	<li>Some AC internal fixes for inaccurate lap count data</li>
	<li>Don't give damage and tyre wear responses in iRacing</li>
	<li>Added Lee spotter and updated Geoffrey spotter to add missing oval sounds (in latest sound pack update)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.1.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Major internal overhaul to fully support multiclass races - opponents and positions are now tracked correctly for the player's car class, the app doesn't make calls about opponent laptimes, pitting, and other stuff if they're not in the same class as the player</li>
	<li>Added multi-class specific messages for when you're lapping or being lapped by other classes</li>	
	<li>Added multi-class specific voice commands "is the car ahead in my class", "is the car behind my class", "what class is the car ahead", "what class is the car behind" and variations</li>
	<li>More performance improvements</li>
	<li>Speculative fixes for driver swaps in iRacing</li>
	<li>Fixed 'enable driver names' flag being ignored for some messages</li>
	<li>Added optional pit box countdown (R3E and iRacing only, disabled by default - enable with property "pit_box_position_countdown")</li>
	<li>rF2 improvements: improved rolling start detection and distance to safety car detection, in SCR mode Crew Chief now respects DoubleFileType value and will announce last FCY lap Frozen Order instructions correctly</li>
	<li>Added option to change left/right side tyres(iRacing only)</li>
	<li>Modified R3E pit macros to take advantage of modify pit menu behaviour (should make the pit macros, particularly the auto-confirm pit actions, more reliable)</li>
	<li>Retrieve gap ahead / gap behind as late as possible when playing gap messages to improve accuracy</li>
	<li>Made auto-refuel ("fuel to the end" macro in R3E and "pitstop fuel to the end" command in iRacing) a bit more conservative - more so at longer tracks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added messages for oil and fuel pressure warnings (iRacing only)</li>
	<li>Added messages for stalling the engine</li>
	<li>Added messages when you crash very heavily - the app will ask if you're OK and, if you're using voice commands, wait for you to respond (these can be disabled with the "Enable crash messages" option in Properties)</li>
	<li>Only use start-line track temperature in pCARS to prevent the app calling local track temp variations</li>
	<li>Allow multi-class support to be disabled ("Force single class" property) - useful if you're playing with 3rd party content that has incorrect car class IDs</li>
	<li>More performance improvements</li>
	<li>Prevent the app's windows being resized such that controls are no longer visible (this behaviour can be disabled by unchecking the "Force minimum window size" property)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Don't play 'good pass' message in pCARS 2 if we've just collided with someone (might still need some tuning)</li>
	<li>Some minor performance improvements</li>
	<li>Fixed issues with historical weather data being lost</li>
	<li>pCARS 2 pit window fixes (again...)</li>
	<li>Fixed missing DQ / DNF session end messages</li>
	<li>Fixed mid-point fuel report saying "fuel looks good" when it clearly isn't good</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed 'box this lap' messages playing in pCARS2 even though the player had completed his mandatory stop</li>
	<li>Some pCARS2 off track warning tweaks</li>
	<li>Reworked R3E opponent lap invalidation code - should prevent the app incorrectly invalidating opponent laps</li>
	<li>Speculative fix for session end being 1 lap too late for iRacing fixed number of lap races</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added voice command to get and estimate of how much fuel is needed to finish the race - "how much fuel to the end" / "how much fuel do we need"</li>
	<li>Added voice command to get an estimate of how long the tyres will last (in minutes for timed sessions, laps for fixed lap number sessions) - "how long will the tires last" / "how long on these tires" / "how long will these tires last"</li>	
	<li>Added check to prevent a stopped car triggering incident warnings repeatedly</li>
	<li>Added ability to set pit fuel amount in iRacing - "pitstop fuel to the end" / "pitstop fuel to the end of the race" - and via a macro in R3E and pCARS2 - "fuel to the end" / "fuel to the end of the race". See the 'Advanced command macros' section of the help.txt file or this <a href="http://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?263-Command-key-press-macros&p=2378&viewfull=1#post2378">detailed forum post</a> for more info (please read the documentation before using this in R3E or pCARS2 as it requires the default in-game pit strategy to be configured in a particular way, and is quite fragile - use at your own risk).</li>
	<li>Immediately close the pit menu in R3E after running a macro if we're close to the pit entry (if the menu is left open when you cross the limiter line, the auto-confirm macro will fail)</li>
	<li>If sound pack downloads fail, retry with the other server - should fix issue that prevented some users downloading sound updates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Don't make Assetto Corsa spotter calls when viewing replays</li>
	<li>Derive opponent laptimes and sector 3 times in Raceroom instead of using data provided by the game as the data provided by the game are always 1 lap out of date</li>
	<li>Reworked some of the sector gap logic</li>
	<li>Reduce frequency of repeated "the next car is..." messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some issues in pCARS 2 session end detection and pre-start message triggering</li>

	<li>Added possible track cut warning for pCars2</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.9.0.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for rF2 StockCarRules plugin, CC will now announce Lucky Dog, Wave Around, EOLL messages. To enable make sure you enable the "Use American terms" option, disable StockCarRules plugin in rF2, and set "EnableStockCarRulesPlugin":1 for "rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll" - see this <a href="http://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?407-How-to-enable-rF2-Stock-Car-Rules-in-Crew-Chief&p=2931&viewfull=1#post2931">detailed forum post</a> for more information</li>

	<li>More fixes to the manual rolling start logic</li>	
	<li>iRacing session transition crash fix</li>
	<li>Some car class tweaks</li>
	<li>Added nAudio speech recognition code to allow voice recognition input device selection (enable with property "Use nAudio for speech recognition" - thanks to Daniel Nowak for this one)</li>
	<li>Disable sector delta messages on ovals and use more generous spotter parameters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.3.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Corrected some pCARS 2 track names that got changed in the last pCARS 2 patch</li>	
	<li>Disable some irrelvant sounds when racing on ovals</li>
	<li>Work around for some missing spotter sounds</li>
	<li>A few internal fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.3.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Changed personalisations download process to reduce bandwidth use</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a serious regression in multi-class race position tracking (sorry for the double release guys...)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.8</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added more variety to race finish messages</li>	
	<li>Make default R3E pit macro pause a while before closing menu</li>
	<li>Warn when an opponent car is exiting the pits</li>
	<li>A few other minor bits and bobs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Experimental support for double-file manual rolling starts (R3E, pCARS2 & AC only - enable with "Manual formation lap double-file start" property)</li>	
	<li>Fixed arrow keys and some other keys not being released when used in command macros</li>
	<li>iRacing rally cross fixes</li>
	<li>More Formula E battery tracking logic and messages</li>
	<li>Split some longer voice command responses so if you want to hear more, you have to ask ("more information" / "more info" / "clarify") - currently only implemented for Formula E battery messages, but will be extended. If you want all the information in a single long response without having to ask for clarification, enable "Verbose messages" property</li>
	<li>Added missing RF1 / AMS blue flag override ("Enable AMS / rF1 blue on slower" property</li>
	<li>Some internal fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some nAudio bugs that meant the radio beeps were being sent to the wrong audio device</li>	
	<li>Added Hong Kong track mappings (RF2 Formula E pack)</li>
	<li>Added voice command to get player incident count ("how many incidents do I have" / "what's my incident count") and session incident limit ("what's the incident limit") - iRacing only</li>
	<li>Added voice command to get player licence ("what's my licence class") and iRating ("whats my iRating") - iRacing only</li>
	<li>Added voice command to get opponent licence ("what's [the guy in front's / the leader's / p10's / Bob's] licence class") and iRating ("what's [the guy in front's / the leader's / p10's / Bob's] iRating") - iRacing only</li>	
	<li>Fixed tyre temperature thresholds on some R3E car classes</li>
	<li>Battery monitoring bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reworked battery status message (response to voice command/button command), added battery use increase/decrease detection</li>
	<li>Added pit stop related messages for pCARS2</li>
	<li>Some internal bug fixing</li>
	<li>Allow spotter sounds ("car left" etc) to have their volume scaled relative to the other voice messages (property "spotter_volume_boost")</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added battery related logic for electric cars (RF2 Formula E)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.3</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed some performance issues when using nAudio playback</li>
	<li>Some internal sound player rework and bug fixing</li>
	<li>Added "TTS volume boost" - by default the TTS sounds are now played at 2x volume, which balances them better with the the other sounds</li>
	<li>Added TTS trim start and trim end properties to remove silence from TTS sounds</li>
	<li>Added "Only use TTS when there is no alternative" option. When set to 'true' (the default) the app will drop messages or use generic terms to refer to opponents when it doesn't have a driver name recording. It will use TTS for driver names only if the message is considered essential (when e.g. responding to "who's in front?" voice command). The recommended TTS configuration is now to enable TTS, set "Only use TTS when there is no alternative" to true, set "TTS volume boost" to 2, "Trim end of TTS sounds" to 600 and "Trim start of TTS sounds" to 100 - see 'Help and getting started' for more information</li>
	<li>Allow iracing tyre pressure adjustment voice commands to be made in PSI (when property "iRacing tyre pressure adjustments in PSI" is true the app assumes you mean PSI)</li>
	<li>Fixed broken voice recognition for "who's ahead", "who's behind" and "who's leading" commands</li>
	<li>Added Ross spotter to latest sound pack</li>
	<li>Allow iRacing fuel to be added in gallons</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.2.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Work-around for R3E missing sector number updates when cars exit to pits (should fix a lot of inaccurate calls in practice and qualifying)</li>
	<li>Fixed mute not working properly in nAudio mode</li>
	<li>Simplified track landmark generation (see Help)</li>
	<li>Some internal bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Improvements to speech recogntion accuracy</li>
	<li>Integrated nAudio library for sound playback which allows you to choose play back devices for messages and background sounds (disabled by default - enable this with the "Use nAudio for playback" option) - this also allows the app to play back at higher volumes</li>
	<li>Added lots of iRacing pit commands (see the voice commands section in Help)</li>
	<li>Lots of iRacing bug fixes</li>
	<li>Added a new spotter (Micha - in the latest sound pack)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Opponent to player delta bug fixes (all games)</li>
	<li>Added macros for some iRacing black-box interactions</li>
	<li>Added new Pace Notes feature for recording and playing back user-created pace notes (see Help)</li>
	<li>Fixed arrow keys not working for macros</li>
	<li>Fixed a few minor lap time reporting issues</li>
	<li>Lots of iRacing fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Better UI handling of sound pack downloads (app should no longer appear to hang while unpacking sounds)</li>
	<li>Announce retired and DQ'ed drivers in RF2</li>
	<li>Fixed stale driverID in iRacing</li>
	<li>Minor bug fixes - Mark out laps as invalid in R3E (should prevent stale lap time calls at the end of an out lap), RF2 pre-lights and overtake messages and track landmark mapping getting lost on session restart, pCARS 2 pit exit messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Better pruning of pCARS2 stale and duplicated opponent data in online sessions (hacks adapted from pCARS1 to work around bugs inherited from pCARS1)</li>
	<li>Added opponent retired and opponent disqualified messages (pCARS2 / R3E) - will be enabled with next sound pack update</li>
	<li>R3E and pCARS2 car and track mapping fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed an issue in the speech recogniser where grammars were initialised multiple times, reducing recognition accuracy - this should make the recogniser work more reliably</li>
	<li>Fixed an issue in R3E and AC where a invalidated in sector 3 could cause stale best-lap data to be announced</li>
	<li>Remove opponents who are reported as DNF / DQ / DNS in R3E</li>
	<li>Added experimental option 'Disable alternative voice commands' (disabled by default). Enabling this will force the speech recogniser to only load the first command from each row in speech_recognition_config.txt. Instead of recognising any of "who's leading", "who's in the lead", "who is leading", "who is in the lead", or "who's the leader" the app will only recognise the first in the list - "who's leading". This will limit the number of phrases the recogniser understands and *may* improve recognition accuracy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More iRacing bug fixes, mostly around session state tracking</li>
	<li>Improved default pCARS2 command macros (massive thanks to Belaki on the pCARS forums)</li>
	<li>Fixed pCARS2 pit window end message playing when it shouldn't</li>
	<li>RF2 bug fixes</li>
	<li>Added overall damage report - triggered by voice command ("damage report / how's my car / is my car ok") or button assignment</li>
	<li>Added session status report (race time remaining, pit status, gaps etc) - triggered by voice command ("session status / race status") or button assignment</li>
	<li>Added car status report (damage, fuel, tyres etc) - triggered by voice command ("car status") or button assignment</li>
	<li>Added combined status status report (session status + car status report) - triggered by voice command ("full update / full status / update me") or button assignment</li>
	<li>Added a few more messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Corrected and added some corner mappings</li>
	<li>Added function to read corner mappings for the current lap (activated with a button assignment or voice command "read corner names" / "corner names" / "tell me the corner names")</li>
	<li>More iRacing beta updates</li>
	<li>Tweaked overtake message probability</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.1.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>iRacing beta</li>
	<li>pCARS2 beta (shared memory only - UDP isn't ready)</li>
	<li>Pit command macros beta (example implementations for R3E and pCARS2 included - see the "Command macros" section at the end of the Help file, and saved_command_macros.json in the app's installation folder)</li>
	<li>Fixed lap time issues in AC (caused by the laptime not being sent to the app at the same time as the new-lap notification)</li>
	<li>Extended support for RF2 StockCar rules plugin</li>
	<li>More car class and track mapping data</li>
	<li>RF2 opponent pit detection and additional pit messages</li>
	<li>Mute the background sound when you talk to the chief</li>
	<li>Block all messages when you're talking to the chief (optional - use property "Block messages when talking to the Chief")</li>
	<li>Small improvements and bugfixes for RF2, PCars, AC and R3E</li>
	<li>Attempt to predict when it might rain for pCARS and pCARS2 (shared memory only, enabled by default - use property "Enable PCars rain prediction using CloudBrightness" to disable). Note this uses changes in reported CloudBrightness value and is quite inaccurate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.0.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>RF2 fixes - fixed low fuel message playing when it shouldn't, fixed European versions of full course yellow messages not playing on new installs</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.0.6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>RF2 DRS support</li>
	<li>RF1 / AMS and RF2 cut track warnings</li>
	<li>RF2 full-course-yellow, standing start and rolling start order messages (pace line, grid box, left / right column)</li>
	<li>R3E opponent laptime validation fix - should prevent the app playing some incorrect opponent laptimes</li>
	<li>Don't play aero damage if the rest of the car is knackered</li>
	<li>Fixed first lap out of pits massively skewing fuel consumption estimate</li>
	<li>Some other random fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.0.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed broken PCars2 oval track mapping - should now correctly call 'car low' / 'car high' on ovals for all spotters except Geoffrey</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.0.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added some Project Cars 2 stuff - game type, launch options, and a couple of initial track mappings</li>
	<li>Fixed some incorrect tyre temperature warnings</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.8.0.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Updated Assetto Corsa plugin to be compatible with latest AC update</li>
	<li>Added "Block messages when talking to the chief" option - this prevents any messages being played while you're making a voice command</li>
	<li>Some fuel consumption calculation fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.9.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>R3E 64Bit support</li>
	<li>Added voice command to tell you (once the data is availalbe) what the relative performance difference is between different tyre types based on the best lap in the session for tyre type - e.g. "Softs are about 0.4 seconds faster than Mediums, Mediums are about 1.2 seconds faster than Hards". The voice command is "Give me tyre pace differences", "What are the tire speeds?" / "Whats the difference between tires?" / "Compare tire compounds" (R3E and RF2 only)</li>
	<li>Added opponent tyre type info when they leave the pits after changing tyre type (R3E and RF2 only)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.9.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More RF2 race end detection fixes</li>
	<li>Added Imola corner mappings for R3E</li>
	<li>fixed race start message being repeated on manual rolling starts</li>
	<li>Some additional checks to prevent mandatory pitstop messages playing during or after you've completed your stop</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.9.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Compatibility fixes for new Raceroom shared memory layout</li>
	<li>Map to new Raceroom tyre types - you can ask "what tyres is [opponent name] on?", or "what tyres am I on?"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.9.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Better sound pack update mechanism - wastes less bandwidth</li>
	<li>Added "minimise to tray" and "start minimised" options. Minimise to tray places a Crew Chief icon in the system-tray when you minimise the app, with a right-click menu contain commonly used functions. The app can be started minimised if desired</li>
	<li>Added a new fuel calculation command ("calculate fuel for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel do i need for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]") - for example, "how much fuel do I need for twenty minutes?". Assuming the app's had the chance to record your fuel usage over at least one lap (the more the better), it'll estimate how much fuel you'll need for the requested number of laps / time based on your average consumption. <b>IMPORTANT:</b> if you use this to set your fuel load in a timed race you MUST add extra fuel to account for the lap you need to finish after the race timer reaches zero. The app WILL NOT DO THIS FOR YOU - if you put in exactly 20 minutes worth of fuel for a 20 minute race you'll run out on the last lap</li>
	<li>Only allow manual formation lap mode to supress messages in race sessions (fixes missing messages in practice and qual with manual formation lap mode enabled)</li>
	<li>Fixed session end detection in RF2 / AMS / RF1 - the app should also detect when you click 'next session' without clicking 'end session' first</li>
	<li>Fixed some issues in the fuel use tracking logic</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.9.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed initialisation errors in TTS engine which prevented the app from starting when "Use TTS for missing names" was enabled</li>
	<li>added option to select where the race starts on a manual formation lap - "Manual formation 'go' when leader crosses line". If this is true (the default) the app assumes that the race starts and cars are allowed to overtake as soon as the leader crosses the start line. If it's false, the app assumes that no one is allowed to overtake until they cross the start line</li>
	<li>Added some RF1 session identifier fixes - should correct a few issues caused by the app thinking the race was actually qualifying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.8.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fix for some settings getting corrupted on system which use a comma as a decimal separator - this causes some spotter and voice recognition issues. If you have already encountered this, please reload the app's default settings</li>
	<li>Added manual formation lap support. This supresses most messages on lap 1 and plays an alternate sequence of start messages - it assumes you're not allow to pass until you cross the start line. This mode can be activated and deactivated with a button press ("Toggle manual formation lap mode") or a voice command (enable with "this is the formation lap" / "formation lap" / "rolling start", disable with "standing start" / "no formation lap").</li>
	<li>Some fuel use calculation fixes</li>
	<li>Spotter fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.8.6</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added optional radio beeps for when the spotter or the Chief interrupt each other. "Insert beep-out between Spotter and Chief" plays the close-channel beep after the chief / spotter has finished, and "Insert beep-in between Spotter and Chief" (the default) plays the open-channel beep before the chief / spotter interrupts. The spotter and chief use different beep sounds here, and these options can be combined if you want 2 beeps (close then open) when interrupting</li>
	<li>Attempt to delete corrupted settings and force the app to restart if they can't be processed</li>
	<li>Don't play fuel consumption estimate if it's 0 litres per lap</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.8.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>RF2 plugin fixes for car damage issues in online races</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.8.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed spotter logic where it would consider 2 cars along side to be "3 side", even if those cars were one behind the other</li>
	<li>Use oval spotter messages (inside / outside) when on known oval tracks, if the selected spotter has these sounds</li>
	<li>Tweaked spotter enable / disable sound to be a bit more appropriate for non-default spotter voice packs</li>
	<li>Fixed broken sector 3 time deltas in Project Cars</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.7.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Assetto Corsa pit window open calculation for sessions with a fixed number of laps</li>
	<li>Fixed a crash bug when starting the app with no sound pack</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.7.8</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added dropdown to main screen to allow a different spotter voice to be selected</li>
	<li>Added Geoffrey Lessel's awesome spotter sounds - these are in the latest sound pack. Select "Geoffrey" from the new 'Spotter voice pack' menu</li>
	<li>Fixed a couple more spotter bugs</li>	
	<li>Added button binding to get fuel status (consumption and fuel remaining). The "how's my fuel?" voice command now reports the consumption as well as the remaining fuel</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.7.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More Scoops-Brand RF2 corner mappings</li>
	<li>Fixed some spotter bugs</li>
	<li>Added searching to Properties screen to make it a little less user-hostile</li>
	<li>Replaced the nasty underscore_property_names with proper names on the Properties screen</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.7.7.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Substantial RF2 plugin rewrite</li>
	<li>Attempt to map game data if we detect the PCars2 exe - this does (apparently) work but expect some bugs and issues</li>
	<li>Ported some fixes from the PCars Android app - some free practice session improvements, more aggressive pruning of broken driver data, better (hopefully...) method of identifying player's data so monitoring other drivers shouldn't confuse the app</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.7.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Overhauled internal sound handling to make the app behave better</li>
	<li>Use game-provided mandatory pitstop data where available (should fix app thinking you've completed your mandatory pitstop when the game thinks otherwise)</li>
	<li>Some more car and track mappings from Scoops</li>
	<li>Added 'three wide you're on the left' and 'three wide you're on the right' to the spotter - optional, disabled by default (spotter_enable_three_wide_left_and_right in the Properties screen)</li>
	<li>Added voice command to get info about the car in front / behind is slower / faster than you - "where should I attack" / "where am I faster" / "where can I attack" or "where should I defend" / "where am I slower" / "where is he faster" / "where will he attack"</li>
	<li>Mapped Watkins Glen for PCars</li>
	<li>A few bug fixes</li>
	<li>Added fuel use per lap response - "what's my fuel usage" / "what's my fuel consumption" / "what's my fuel use"</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Faster start up times</li>

</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.6.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added a big set of corner name and location data thanks to Scoops' hard work</li>
	<li>Overhauled yellow flag logic for sector yellows and local yellows</li>
	<li>Read times accurate to hundredths of a second in some circumstances</li>
	<li>Added oval-specific behaviours (enabled per-track with a flag in trackLandmarks.json) - ignores brake and left side tyre temps, estimates tyre wear from right side tyres only</li>
	<li>Added an experimental 'realistic mode' option - enabling this supresses some messages based on car class and track (e.g. spotter is off at start of session when not on ovals, older car classes have less telemetry based info like tyre temps) - this is very much 'work in progress'; added per-car class behaviours for yellow flag phrasing (e.g. pace car vs safety car) and last lap message (e.g. "white flag" for last lap only applies to Indy and NASCAR cars)</li>
	<li>Added 'force update check' button</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.5.2</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed AC plugin after 1.14 update</li>

<ul>
	<li>Automatically switch between yellow and blue flag implementations in R3E depending on whether flag rules are enabled in-game</li>
	<li>Added some more incident calling and yellow flag options</li>
	<li>Added button mapping and voice command to suspend and enable yellow flag messages - enable with "give me yellows", "tell me yellows", "give me incident updates" or "give me yellow flag updates". Disable with "no more yellows", "stop incident updates", "don't give me yellows" or "don't tell me yellows"</li>
	<li>Fixed the "where is Bob?" voice message response in qual and practice sessions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.4.9</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added R3E Mantorp Park (long), Norisring and Sachsenring corner data</li>
	<li>A bit more R3E flag tweaking</li>

<ul>
	<li>Fix crash bug in PCars with UDP data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.4.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added installer for game specific plugins (AC, AMS / RF1 and RF2) - the app now offers to copy the required plugin files to the games' install directory if they're missing or out of date</li>
	<li>extended incident reporting logic and sounds to allow for multiple involved drivers to be reported (if we have the driver name sounds) or 'pileup' warning if 4 or more drivers are stopped in the same corner</li>
	<li>added more corner names</li>

	<li>Revised RF2 and AMS opponent data handling to fix missing gap messages</li>
	<li>More work on AMS session end bugs</li>
	<li>Added better reporting of yellow flags for AMS and RF2 - the app will sometimes tell you who's involved in the incident and what corner the incident is in</li>
	<li>Added simple incident reporting for known corners in R3E, AC and PCars</li>
	<li>Added attack / defend calls for known corners (note these messages don't play often - this is intentional)</li>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed broken settings preventing changes to any setting from being saved</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.6.1.1</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Integrated personalisations - the app will ask you to download a new "Personalisations" sound pack. When this is complete the "My name" drop down box (top right) has a long list of names the app can use when addressing you. This replaces the old method of manually unpacking a prefixes_and_suffixes folder to the app's sounds</li>
	<li>Work-around for Assetto Corsa sometimes giving out of date position information</li>
	<li>Disable multi-class code for RF1 based games because the vehicle type data from Automobilista is too vague (things like "Ford" and "Peugeot")</li>
	<li>Ported RF2 full course yellow and sector-specific yellow flag announcements to Automobilista</li>
	<li>Removed irrelvant pit window messages from RF1 based sims - in offline sessions, if a pit schedule is defined the app will call "box now" in accordance with this schedule (assuming equal stint lengths) - this can be disabled with enable_ams_pit_schedule_messages property</li>

	<li>Added RF2 caution period and yellow flag events</li>
	<li>Scan for controllers only on request (press the "Scan for controllers" button to update the app's list of controllers) - this also improves the app's startup time</li>
	<li>Fixed Assetto Corsa missing race start after 1.12 patch</li>
	<li>Added chequered flag message for timed sessions (still some issues here with PCars)</li>
	<li>Reworked PCars session end detection; added controller bindings for message volume up / down</li>
	<li>Added some simple help text (much much more needs to be added to this)</li>

	<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.5.0.0</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed some issues with pre-lights messages</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4.2.0</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Reworked pre-lights message logic (optional) - app will play race session messages while you're on the grid until the throttle / brake / clutch is pressed, then it'll play the 'get ready' message. This can be enabled by selecting 'play_pre_lights_messages_until_cancelled' option on the Properties screen</li>
	<li>Some driver name mapping fixes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.4.1.3</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Version 4.2.1.7</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use lastSectorTime and lapInvalidated data for opponent cars when in PCars UDP (network data) mode.

	<li>Fixed best lap and brake damage voice commands</li>
	<li>More frequent opponent gap reports on longer tracks</li>
	<li>Added brake and tyre temp warning on pit exit (when temps aren't optimal) - these are optional (brake temp warning is on by default, tyre temp warning is off)</li>
	<li>Some voice commands now trigger a "stand by" response, then a few seconds later the actual response (optional, enabled by default - uses "enable_delayed_responses" property)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.6.3</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added Raceroom Formula Junior class</li>
	<li>Tweaked Raceroom engine damage thresholds</li>

</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.5</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Disable PCars pit window messages by default (can be re-enabled with the enable_pcars_pit_window_messages setting) - this only works correctly in offline races</li>
	<li>Revised some of the PCars session-end logic to reduce the likelihood of the app detecting a session restart when one hasn't actually taken place. This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 4.1.4.4</h2>
<ul>
	<li>More pit window logic fixes for PCars</li>
	<li>Don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the race is a fixed time</li>
</ul>

	<li>Don't play a message twice in succession if a player asks for something that the app was going to tell them anyway</li>
	<li>Don't play good / OK start messages if the player has picked up a penalty (i.e. false start)</li>
	<li>Insert a short pause between some messages</li>
	<li>Reduce the likelihood of multiple sweary messages being played in quick succession</li>
