Getting started
-----------------------

Crew Chief requires the .Net framework, version 4.6. This is included in Windows 10 but Windows 7 and Window 8 users will need to install it.

When you first start Crew Chief the app will be installed with no sounds. The UI should have 2 big buttons, highlighted in green. Pressing these will download the sound pack (voice messages) and optional (but highly recommended) driver names. Press them both and when they're both complete, you'll be prompted to restart the application.

For Raceroom and Project Cars, Crew Chief is self contained and needs no other software and almost no configuration. For rFactor 1 based games, rFactor 2 and Assetto Corsa there are a couple of extra steps required. 

For voice recognition (entirely optional but quite handy and very cool) see below.

If you're stuck or just want to catch up on what's going on with the app, there's a Crew Chief forum here: http://thecrewchief.org


Raceroom:

To use Crew Chief with Raceroom simply select Raceroom from Crew Chief's Game menu and click the Start button.


Project Cars:

Project Cars can be run in 3 modes - 32 bit, 64 bit or Network. I recommend trying Nework first (the app will have access to more accurate information). In Project Cars' Gameplay menu, set UDP to 2 or 3. Select Project Cars (network data) from Crew Chief's Game menu and click the Start button. For some users this might not work due to the way the game sends data in this mode. If it doesn't work for you try selecting Project Cars (64 bit) or Project Cars (32 bit) from the Game menu, depending on which version of the game you're running (for most users this will be 64 bit). Be aware that in these modes the app has to time opponent laps itself, so the opponent laptime reporting will not be as accurate as it is for Network mode.


Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas:

You need Dan Allongo's plugin for these games. The app will check if this plugin is installed in the correct game folder. If it isn't, the app will offer to install it for you when you start the app with Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas selected. In most cases all you need do is click the "OK" button in the popup.

If this process fails for any reason, copy the rFactorSharedMemoryMap.dll from the app's plugins folder - usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT Ltd\CrewChiefV4\plugins\rfactor1\Plugins\rFactorSharedMemoryMap.dll to the Automobilista / RF1 / Game Stock Car Extreme / Formula Truck / Copa Petrobras de Marcas 'Plugins' folder (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Automobilista\Plugins). Once you've done this just select the game from Crew Chief's Game menu and press the Start button.

The source code for this plugin is here: https://github.com/dallongo/rFactorSharedMemoryMap


rFactor 2:

You need Vytautas Leonavičius' plugin for rFactor 2. The app will check if this plugin is installed in the correct game folder. If it isn't, the app will offer to install it for you when you start the app with rF2 selected. In most cases all you need do is click the "OK" button in the popup.

If this process fails for any reason, copy the rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll from the app's plugins folder - usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT Ltd\CrewChiefV4\plugins\rFactor 2\Bin64\Plugins\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll to the rFactor2 'Plugins' folder (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor2\Bin64\Plugins). You need to enable this plugin from the game's Options->Plugins UI.

Note: 32 bit rFactor 2 is no longer supported.


Assetto Corsa:

You need Morten Roslev's Python plugin for Assetto Corsa. The app will check if this plugin is installed in the correct game folder. If it isn't, the app will offer to install it for you when you start the app with Assetto Corsa selected. In most cases all you need do is click the "OK" button in the popup.

If this process fails for any reason, copy the folder called 'CrewChiefEx' from the app's plugins folder - usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT Ltd\CrewChiefV4\plugins\assettocorsa\apps\python\CrewChiefEx to the Asstto Corsa python folder (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python). You might need to enable this plugin in the Assetto Corsa UI. Once you've done this just select the game from Crew Chief's Game menu and press the Start button.



Startup issues
------------------
If the app refuses to start, or starts then closes itself, try deleting the app's configuration files. To do this go to C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Britton_IT_Ltd\ and delete all the subfolders in there. This will reset all the app's settings to default. Note that the 'AppData' folder is hidden by default on Windows - you may need to change the View settings in the File Explorer Options from Windows Control Panel - look for a setting called "Show hidden files and folders".

There may also be an error logged in the Windows Event logs - look for .Net errors in the Application Logs section.



Properties
-------------------
The app includes a rather rudamentary preferences screen accessed by the "Properties" button. Many many aspects of that app's behaviour can be customised here but it's important to note that you don't have to make any changes to these properties to get the app to work correctly - the defaults are sensisble settings and the app doesn't need any configuration (except for swearing - see below).

We've added a search capability to the window.  Most of CC options apply to all simulators, but you can also search for game specific preferences by typing ACS, AMS, R3E, rF1, rF2 or pCars to filter accordingly.



Swearing
-----------------
Because swearing is cool and I'm a 12 year old stuck in a middle-aged body, this has its own help section. Swearing is disabled by default so once you've got the app working you'll want to enable it because swearing is cool. Look for a checkbox in the Properties screen called "Use sweary messages" (search for "sweary" using the search box) and tick it. The app will swear where appropriate - it's not like listening to an Eddie Murphy gig and doesn't happen very often but it does help add a bit of personality to the messages.



Personalisations
------------------------
The "My name" dropdown menu in the top right of the main UI allows you to select from a list of names which the app will use to address you, from time to time. These are incorporated into existing messages so for example, rather than just saying "box now" the app will say "box now, please Jim". There are lots of variations and they sound quite good, if you are lucky enough to have a first name that's in this list. How often you hear these personalised messages is controlled by the "Min time between personalised messages" property. The old default value (30s) is a bit low - 60s sounds better. The Personalisations come in the form of a mini-sound pack which is downloaded and managed by the app (they used to require lots of manual faffing) - if new personalisations are available the "Download personalisations" button will he highlighted in green. Swapping between personalisations requires an app restart.



Voice Recognition
-------------------------
You'll need to install the Microsoft Speech Recognition runtime which is here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=27225
From this page click 'Download' and select the right version - for most users this will be x64_SpeechPlatformRuntime\SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi
Once you've installed this, you'll also need to install a language pack - https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=27224 
Again, from this page click 'Download' and select the right version - for most users this will be MSSpeech_SR_en-US_TELE.msi (US users) or MSSpeech_SR_en-GB_TELE.msi (UK users).

This is not the same as the voice recognition technology built into Windows - it isn't installed with Windows by default.

Crew Chief will use the "Default" recording device for voice recognition - this can be selected in the "Recording devices" section of the Window Sounds control panel.

Voice recognition can be configured to be always-on (it listens continuously and responds when it recognises a command) or in response to a button press. To assign a button to a activate voice recognition, press the 'Scan for controllers' button at the bottom of Crew Chief UI. This will populate the 'Available controllers' list. Then select the controller you want to use from this list and select the 'Talk to crew chief' item from the 'Available actions' list. Then click the 'Assign control' button and press the wheel / controller / keyboard button you want to use for this action. By default you have to hold this button down while you talk - this can be changed by selecting a different 'Voice recognition mode'.

If you want to test voice recognition, set it all up and press the Start button in Crew Chief, then press your voice recognition button and ask "Can you head me?". If the app can understand you it'll respond with "Yes, I can hear you".

The app understands lots of command including:

"how's my [fuel / tyre wear / body work / aero / engine / transmission / suspension / pace ]"
"how are my [tyre temps / tyre temperatures / brakes / brake temps / brake temperatures / engine temps / engine temperatures]" (gives a good / bad type response)
"What are my [brake temps / tyre temps]" (gives the actual temps)
"what's my [gap in front / gap ahead / gap behind / last lap / last lap time / lap time / position / fuel level / best lap / best lap time]"
"what's the fastest lap" (reports the fastest lap in the session for the player's car class)
"keep quiet / I know what I'm doing / leave me alone" (switches off messages)
"keep me informed / keep me posted / keep me updated" (switches messages back on)
"how long's left / how many laps are left / how many laps to go"
"spot / don't spot" (switches the spotter on and off - note even in "leave me alone" mode the spotter still operates unless you explicitly switch it off)
"do I still have a penalty / do I have a penalty / have I served my penalty"
"do I have to pit / do I need to pit / do I have a mandatory pit stop / do I have a mandatory stop / do I have to make a pit stop"
"where's [opponent driver last name]"
"what's [opponent driver last name]'s last lap"
"what's [opponent driver last name]'s best lap"
"what's [opponent race position]'s last lap" (for example, "what's p 4's best lap", or "what's position 4's last lap")
"what's [opponent race position]'s best lap"
"what's [the car in front / the guy in front / the car ahead / the guy ahead]'s last lap"
"what's [the car in front / the guy in front / the car ahead / the guy ahead]'s best lap"
"what's [the car behind / the guy behind]'s last lap"
"what's [the car behind / the guy behind]'s best lap"
"what tyre(s) is [opponent driver last name / opponent race position] on" (DTM 2014 only - reports "options" or "primes")
"what are my sector times"
"what's my last sector time"
"what's the [air / track] [temp / temperature]"
"who's leading" (this one only works if you have the driver name recording for the lead car)
"who's [ahead / ahead in the race / in front / in front in the race / behind / behind in the race]" (gives the name of the car in front / behind in the race or on the timing sheet for qual / practice. This one only works if you have the driver name recording for that driver)
"who's [ahead on track / in front on track / behind on track]" (gives the name of the car in front / behind in on track, regardless of his race / qual position. This one only works if you have the driver name recording for that driver)
"tell me the gaps / give me the gaps / tell me the deltas / give me the deltas" (switch on 'deltas' mode where the time deltas in front and behind get read out on each lap. Note that these messages will play even if you have disabled messages)
"don't tell me the gaps / don't tell me the deltas / no more gaps / no more deltas" (switch off deltas mode)
"repeat last message / say again" (replays the last message)
"What are my [brake / tyre] [temperatures / temps]"
"What time is it / what's the time" (reports current real-world time)
"What's my fuel usage / what's my fuel consumption / what's my fuel use" (reports the per-lap or per-minute average fuel consumption)
"What tires am I on / what tire am / on / what tire type am i on" (reports the tyre name you're currently using, if available)
"Calculate fuel for [X minutes / laps] / how much fuel do I need for [X minutes / laps] / how much fuel for [X minutes / laps]" (estimates how much fuel you'll probably need for this many minutes or laps)
"Give me tyre pace differences / what are the tire speeds / whats the difference between tires / compare tire compounds" (Raceroom only - gives lap time deltas for the best lap on each tyre type that's been used during the session, across all drivers in the same car class as the player)
"This is the formation lap / formation lap / rolling start": Enable manual rolling-start mode (used by some online leagues)
"Standing start / no formation lap": Disable manual rolling-start mode
"Where should I attack / where am I faster / where can I attack": If the app has enough data, will report the corner name where you're gaining the most time on the guy in front
"Where should I defend / where am I slower / where is he faster / where will he attack": If the app has enough data, will report the corner name where you're losing the most time to the guy behind
"Read corner names / corner names / tell me the corner names": read out each corner name when you hit the mid-point of the corner, for this lap only (useful to test corner name mappings)
"Damage report / how's my car / is my car ok" : read out any damage you have
"Car status" : read out any damage, along with tyre wear, brake wear, engine temps etc if the values for these are not in the ideal range
"Session status / race status" : give an overview of the session - time left, position, gaps, pitstop status etc
"Full update / full status / update me" : damage report, car status and session status combined
"What's the time / what time is it" : read the current (clock) time



Command macros
--------------
The app can send sequences of key presses in response to voice command or some specific (hard-coded) in-game events. These can be used for anything you like, but their primary function is to ease the pain of navigating the awkward in-game pit menus. The app comes with a default set of command macros which (at the time of writing) are for PCars2 and Raceroom only. More will be added for other games. The default commands can be found in [install folder]/saved_command_macros.json. If you want to make your own, copy this file to a your Documents folder, in a subfolder called CrewChiefV4 (i.e. Documents/CrewChiefV4/saved_command_macros.json) and edit it as you like. 

The first thing you need to do is to update your key assignments in-game so they match the keys that the command macro will send. 


Raceroom

default key bindings:
"Pit Menu Toggle":		q
"Pit Menu Select": 		e
"Pit Menu Up": 		w
"Pit Menu Down":		s
"Pit Menu Decrease":	a
"Pit Menu Increase":	d
"Pit Request Toggle":	r

Ensure that there's a least one Pitstop Preset defined (from the in-game pit menu).

You can request a pit stop by saying "pit request", "in this lap" or "box this lap". This will open the pit menu, select 'pit request' and close it again. When you enter the pitlane the app will automatically open select 'confirm pit actions' from the pit menu so you don't have to fumble around.

If you get a drive through or stop-go penalty, the app will automatically open the pit menu and select 'serve penalty', and close it again. When you then enter the pitlane it'll automatically confirm that action. So you don't need to do anything to serve a drive through other than enter the pitlane (at the right speed of course).

You can also cycle pit presets with the voice commands "next strategy", "next pit preset", "previous strategy", "previous pit preset".

If you want to manually navigate the pit menu with voice commands, use "pit menu toggle", "pit menu up", "pit menu down", "pit menu left", "pit menu right" and "pit menu select".


PCars2

default key bindings:
"Car Management":	e
"ICM Menu Up":	w
"ICM Menu Down":	s
"ICM Menu Left":	a
"ICM Menu Right":	d

You can request a pit stop by saying "pit request", "in this lap" or "box this lap". This will open the pit menu, select 'pit request' and close it again.

You can select strategies with the voice commands "strategy one" / "strat one", up to "strategy four" / "strat four".

If you want to manually navigate the pit menu with voice commands, use "pit menu toggle", "pit menu up", "pit menu down", "pit menu left" and "pit menu right".



Training sessions
-----------------
The app can record and playback messages recorded by the player as they drive around. The distance around the lap when a recording is made is saved, so when these messages are played back they trigger at the same point on the track. This allows you to drive slowly round and make audio notes about how to handle particular sections of track, and these are played back as if an instructor was sitting along side you.

These training sessions can be shared between users - just ensure they're copied into the correct folder structure under your Documents folder. The app expects them to be in /Documents/CrewChiefV4/training_sounds/[game-name]/[car-name]/[track-name]/ (e.g. /Documents/CrewChiefV4/training_sounds/pCARS2/F3/Donington GP/. If you omit the car-name part of this path, the training session will be available for any car class.


Recording training sessions:
To record a new training session, you need to run the speech recognition feature in 'hold button' mode, and you need to assign a button to the "Start / stop recording training session" action.

Start a practice session and press the 'Start / stop recording training session' button. The app will now record any voice commands you make instead of passing them to the speech recogniser. The voice recordings along with the distance-round-track will be saved in a folder inside the CrewChiefV4 folder in your Documents folder (which is automatically generated), with the game name, car name and track name (e.g. /Documents/CrewChiefV4/training_sounds/pCARS2/F3/Donington GP/).

Drive slowly around the track and when you reach a point on the track where you want to record some training advice (say, you're approaching a braking zone), hold the "Talk to Crew Chief" button down and record your advice (perhaps something like "brake at the 100 metre board, put the left side wheels in the pit exit lane. 3rd gear, turn in late and hard") and release the button when you're done. Drive to the next point where you want to record something and repeat the process. Keep doing this until you're satisfied you've got all the advice recorded that you want - note that you can do this over multiple laps, or even multiple sessions (if the app spots an existing training session in your Documents folder for the same game / car / track combination it will add to it). When you're done, press the "Start / stop recording training session" button again and the app will save all the data.

Doing this creates a set of .wav files and a metadata.json file which contains supporting information allowing the wav files and the track distance to be matched up. The wav files can be filtered and modified as you like - just ensure they aren't renamed.


Playing back training sessions:
If there is a training session for the game / car / track combination you're using in your Documents folder, you can start this running with the voice command "start training messages" and stop it with the voice command "stop training messages", or you can assign a button to the "Start / stop playing training session" action. When the training session is being played, each of the messages in the session will be played when you reach the point on the track where it was recorded. They will continue to be played until you press the button again or make the "stop training messages" voice command.
