Update the Assembly Information Assembly Version in CrewChiefV4 -> project -> properties (4.x.y.z) - this is needed for the autoupdater to work

Go to General Information in Organize Your Setup (in the build project in Solution Explorer)

Update the Product Version to match the Assembly Version
CAREFULLY change Product Code in Organize Setup -> General Info -> product code, generate a new GUID (on right of UI). DO NOT CHANGE THE UPGRADE CODE GUID - IT MUST ALWAYS BE 731ED4D4-F49C-4844-8C4F-FDE17802FDA8

Ensure the build type is 'SingleImage' (white box in top tool bar), then clean / build to create a .msi with all the goodies packaged into it.


Update the contents of primary/auto_update_data.xml and secondary/auto_update_data.xml - the title, version and date elements, and if necessary the sound pack version stuff
Update the readme and change_log_for_auto_updated.txt for the changes

Push the newly built /.../SingleImage/DiskImages/DISK1/CrewChiefV4.msi, the change_log_for_auto_updated.xml and primary/auto_update_data.xml to the Crew Chief FTP server (thecrewchief.org). It's safest (but not essential) to rename the existing Crew.msi instead of deleting it. Push the newly built /.../SingleImage/DiskImages/DISK1/CrewChiefV4.msi and change_log_for_auto_updated.xml to the secondary FTP server (isnais.de). Push secondary/auto_update_data.xml to GoogleDrive, overwriting the existing one (and therefore keeping the same URL)


The sound pack, personalisations and driver names pack each have a version info file - sound_pack_version_info.txt, personalisations_version_info.txt and driver_names_version_info.txt. These are in the root of the sounds folder, root of the personalisations folder and the root of the driver_names folder respectively. These start at 100.

The sound pack is the voice, fx, background_sounds folders, sound_pack_version_info.txt and updates.txt files, zipped from the root of sounds (i.e. no additional top level folder in the .zip). The driver names pack is just the zipped driver_names folder (the zip file contains a single folder called driver_names, which has the all the contents in it, including the version file). Same for the personalisations.

The sound pack has 3 update files - the base_sound_pack.zip (everything), the update_sound_pack.zip (an older update file, which contains all the newer sounds and is used to update older installations) and a update_2_sound_pack.zip (all the newer sounds used to update newer installations). The driver_names and personalisation still only have 2 update files. But this needs to be reworked as a lot of bandwidth is getting wasted in the update.

Updating these requires the base_ and update_ (and update_2 for sound pack) be packaged and pushed to the whatever FTP server is set for them in the auto_update_data.xml files. At the time of writing, all sound updates are downloaded from the secondary FTP server (isnais.de) but this may change.

ZIP ENCODING!!!	The auto updater stuff requires UTF-8 Always as the encoding for driver names (which can have non-Latin chars in their file names). This will NOT work with Windows built in Zip file viewer. This means we need to zip the auto update driver names zip file using UTF-8 "Always" encoding and unzip it with Encoding.UTF8. The sound files and personalisations don't have this complication (for now - all personalisations use Latin-1 chars only).

Use DotNetZip for this
