Update the Assembly Information Assembly Version in CrewChiefV4 -> project -> properties (4.x.y.0) - this is needed for the autoupdater to work

Go to General Information in Organize Your Setup (in the build project in Solution Explorer)

Update the Product Version to match the Assembly Version
CAREFULLY change Product Code in Organize Setup -> General Info -> product code, generate a new GUID (on right of UI). DO NOT CHANGE THE UPGRADE CODE GUID - IT MUST ALWAYS BE 731ED4D4-F49C-4844-8C4F-FDE17802FDA8

Ensure the build type is 'SingleImage' (white box in top tool bar), then clean / build to create a .msi with all the goodies packaged into it.


Update the contents of auto_update_data.xml - the title and version elements, and if necessary the sound pack version stuff
Update the change_log_for_auto_updated.txt

Push the newly built /.../SingleImage/DiskImages/DISK1/CrewChiefV4.msi and the 2 text files up to DropBox, overwriting the existing ones (and therefore keeping the same URLs)


The sound pack and driver names pack each have a version info file - sound_pack_version_info and driver_names_version_info. These are in the root of the sounds folder and the root of the driver_names folder respectively. These start at 100.

The sound pack is the voice, fx, background_sounds folders and sound_pack_version_info file, zipped from the root of sounds (i.e. no additional top level folder in the .zip). The driver names pack is just the zipped driver_names folder (the zip file contains a single folder called driver_names, which has the all the contents in it, including the version file).

ZIP ENCODING!!!	The auto updater stuff requires UTF-8 Always as the encoding. This will NOT work with Windows built in Zip file viewer. This means we need to zip the auto update driver names zip file using UTF-8 "Always" encoding and unzip it with Encoding.UTF8. The sound files doesn't have this complication.
Use DotNetZip for this
