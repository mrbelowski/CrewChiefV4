CrewChief version 4.9

Written by Jim Britton (main app, voice acting, Raceroom and PCars implementations), Morten Roslev (Assetto Corsa and iRacing implementation), Vytautas Leonaviƒçius (rFactor2 implementation), Dan Allongo (Automobilista and rFactor1 implementation), Daniel Nowak (nAudio speech recognition port) and Mike Schreiner (technical input on stock car rules). The application is the result of lots of lots of hard work and input from the guys above as well as some great advice and support from the community and the guys at Sector3 and SMS.

Additional material from Scoops (fantastic track layout mapping work). Fantastic alternate spotter sounds by Geoffrey Lessel, Matt Orr (aka EmptyBox), Clare Britton, Mike Schreiner, Phil Linden, Lee Taylor and Micha (last name?). Also a thank you to Nick Thissen for his work on iRacingSdkWrapper.

The source code for Crew Chief is available here: https://github.com/mrbelowski/CrewChiefV4

For support and discussions about Crew Chief we have our very own forum here: http://thecrewchief.org/

The full changelog is now at the end of this file.


Quick start
-----------
You need to install .net 4.5 or above to use the app. Download the CrewChiefV4.msi installer and run it. Start the app. Click the "Download sound pack" button and the "Download driver names" button to get the latest sounds and driver names. Select a game from the list at the top right. When the sounds and driver names have finished downloading, click the "Start Application" button. Then fire up the game. Note that the app comes with swearing 'off' by default - if you want to be sworn at you need to enable this in the Properties UI.


Running with voice recognition
------------------------------
If you want to use voice recognition, download the correct speech recognition installers for your system (speech_recognition_32bit.zip or speech_recognition_64bit.zip). Run SpeechPlatformRuntime.msi (this is the MS speech recognition engine), then run MSSpeech_SR_en-GB_TELE.msi or MSSpeech_SR_en-US_TELE.msi depending on your preferred accent (these are the 'cultural info' installers). If you want to use US speech recognition (MSSpeech_SR_en-US_TELE.msi) you must modify the "speech_recognition_location" property to "en-US". This can be done by editing CrewChiefV4.exe.config, or by modifying the property value in the application's Properties area. If you're happy with en-GB you don't need to do anything other than run the 2 speech recognition installers.

For speech recognition, you need a microphone configured as the default "Recording" device in Windows.

To get started, run CrewChiefV4.exe and choose a "Voice recognition mode". There are 3 modes (the radio buttons at the bottom right). "Disabled" means that the app won't attempt any speech recognition. "Hold button" means you have to hold down a button while you speak, and release the button when you're finished. "Toggle button" means you press a button once to start the speech recognition, and the app will continue to listen and process your spoken requests until you press the button again to switch it off (while the app is listening you can make as many voice requests as you like, you don't need to toggle speech recognition off and back on again if you want to ask another question). "Always on" means the app is always listening for and processing speech commands. Selecting "Disabled" or "Always on" from this list makes the app ignore the button assigned to "Talk to crew chief".

If you want to use Hold button or Toggle button mode, select a controller device ("Available controllers" list, bottom left), choose "Talk to crew chief" in the "Available actions" list and click "Assign control". Then press the button you want to assign to your radio button. 

You need to speak clearly and your mic needs to be properly set up - you might need to experiment with levels and gain (Microphone boost) in the Windows control panel. If he understood he'll respond - perhaps with helpful info, perhaps with "we don't have that data". If he doesn't quite understand he'll ask you to repeat yourself. If he can't even tell if you've said something he'll remain silent. There's some debug logging in the main window that might be useful.

I've not finished implementing this but currently the app understands and responds to the following commands:

"how's my [fuel / tyre wear / body work / aero / engine / transmission / suspension / pace ]"
"how are my [tyre temps / tyre temperatures / brakes / brake temps / brake temperatures / engine temps / engine temperatures]" (gives a good / bad type response)
"What are my [brake temps / tyre temps]" (gives the actual temps)
"what's my [gap in front / gap ahead / gap behind / last lap / last lap time / lap time / position / fuel level / best lap / best lap time]"
"what's the fastest lap" (reports the fastest lap in the session for the player's car class)
"keep quiet / I know what I'm doing / leave me alone" (switches off messages)
"keep me informed / keep me posted / keep me updated" (switches messages back on)
"how long's left / how many laps are left / how many laps to go"
"spot / don't spot" (switches the spotter on and off - note even in "leave me alone" mode the spotter still operates unless you explicitly switch it off)
"do I still have a penalty / do I have a penalty / have I served my penalty"
"do I have to pit / do I need to pit / do I have a mandatory pit stop / do I have a mandatory stop / do I have to make a pit stop"
"where's [opponent driver last name]"
"what's [opponent driver last name]'s last lap"
"what's [opponent driver last name]'s best lap"
"what's [opponent race position]'s last lap" (for example, "what's p 4's best lap", or "what's position 4's last lap")
"what's [opponent race position]'s best lap"
"what's [the car in front / the guy in front / the car ahead / the guy ahead]'s last lap"
"what's [the car in front / the guy in front / the car ahead / the guy ahead]'s best lap"
"what's [the car behind / the guy behind]'s last lap"
"what's [the car behind / the guy behind]'s best lap"
"what tyre(s) is [opponent driver last name / opponent race position] on"
"what are my sector times"
"what's my last sector time"
"what's the [air / track] [temp / temperature]
"who's leading" (this one only works if you have the driver name recording for the lead car)
"who's [ahead / ahead in the race / in front / in front in the race / behind / behind in the race]" (gives the name of the car in front / behind in the race or on the timing sheet for qual / practice. This one only works if you have the driver name recording for that driver)
"who's [ahead on track / in front on track / behind on track]" (gives the name of the car in front / behind in on track, regardless of his race / qual position. This one only works if you have the driver name recording for that driver)
"tell me the gaps / give me the gaps / tell me the deltas / give me the deltas" (switch on 'deltas' mode where the time deltas in front and behind get read out on each lap. Note that these messages will play even if you have disabled messages)
"don't tell me the gaps / don't tell me the deltas / no more gaps / no more deltas" (switch off deltas mode)
"repeat last message / say again" (replays the last message)
"What are my [brake / tyre] [temperatures / temps]"
"What time is it / what's the time" (reports current real-world time)
"What's my fuel usage / what's my fuel consumption / what's my fuel use" (reports the per-lap or per-minute average fuel consumption)
"What tires am I on / what tire am / on / what tire type am i on" (reports the tyre name you're currently using, if available)
"Calculate fuel for [X minutes / laps] / how much fuel do I need for [X minutes / laps] / how much fuel for [X minutes / laps]" (estimates how much fuel you'll probably need for this many minutes or laps)
"Give me tyre pace differences / what are the tire speeds / whats the difference between tires / compare tire compounds" (Raceroom only - gives lap time deltas for the best lap on each tyre type that's been used during the session, across all drivers in the same car class as the player)
"This is the formation lap / formation lap / rolling start": Enable manual rolling-start mode (used by some online leagues)
"Standing start / no formation lap": Disable manual rolling-start mode
"Where should I attack / where am I faster / where can I attack": If the app has enough data, will report the corner name where you're gaining the most time on the guy in front
"Where should I defend / where am I slower / where is he faster / where will he attack": If the app has enough data, will report the corner name where you're losing the most time to the guy behind
"Read corner names / corner names / tell me the corner names": read out each corner name when you hit the mid-point of the corner, for this lap only (useful to test corner name mappings)
"Damage report" / "How's my car" / "Is my car ok?": report any damage the car has sustained
"Car status": report any damage the car has sustained, tyre and brake temperature status and fuel / battery status
"Session status" / "Race status": report race position, gaps, time / laps left in session
"Full update" / "Full status" / "Update me": combines all of the above three status reports (will produce a very verbose response)
"how much fuel to the end" / "how much fuel do we need": report how many litres or gallons of fuel the app thinks you'll need to finish the race
"is the car ahead in my class" / "is the car ahead my class" / "is the car ahead the same class as me" / "is the car in front in my class" / "is the car in front my class" / "is the car in front the same class as me" - responds yes or no
"is the car behind in my class" / "is the car behind my class" / "is the car behind the same class as me" - responds yes or no
"what class is the car ahead" / "what class is the guy ahead" / "what class is the car in front" / "what class is the guy in front" - reports class name, or "faster" / "slower" if the app doesn't have the class name
"what class is the car behind" / "what class is the guy behind"- reports class name, or "faster" / "slower" if the app doesn't have the class name
"time this stop" / "practice pitstop" / "time this pitstop" / "pitstop benchmark": time the next pitstop (sector 3 + sector 1 time) to work out home much tome overall a pitstop costs - practice session only
"where will I be after a stop?" / "Estimate pit exit positions" / "What will happen if I pit?": play estimate of traffic and race positions on pit exit, if you were to pit on this lap

Speech recognition customisation
--------------------------------
If you want to change the phrases the app listens for (e.g. instead of asking "how's my tyre wear", perhaps you want to as "how's my boots looking"), create a file called "speech_recognition_config.txt" in [user]\AppData\Local\CrewChiefV4 and use this to override the defaults found in [installDir]\speech_recognition_config.txt



Other button assignments
------------------------
You can assign the 'toggle spotter on/off', 'toggle race updates on/off', 'toggle opponent deltas' and 'repeat last message' to separate buttons if you want to be able to toggle the spotter function and toggle the crew chief's updates on or off during the race. This doesn't require voice recognition to be installed - simply run the app, assign a button to one or both of these functions, and when in-race pressing that button will toggle the spotter / crew chief / opponent deltas on and off.


Properties
----------
When you first run the app it will create a user configuration folder in /Users/[username]/AppData/local/CrewChiefV4 (for example, on my system this is in C:\Users\Jim\AppData\Local\CrewChiefV4). This folder holds your application settings. The settings can be accessed by clicking the "Properties" button in the app. This displays a popup window where you can tweak stuff if you want to. This interface is a bit rubbish but should let you tweak settings if you want to, although the properties are all (currently) undocumented. If you do change something in this interface, the app needs to restart to pick up the change - the "Save and restart" button should do this.

Each property has a "reset to default" button, or if you get completely stuck you can close the app and delete the user configuration folder and it should reset everything.


Custom controllers
------------------
This is untested. If your controller doesn't show up in the list of available controllers you can set the "custom_controller_guid" property to the GUID of your controller device. If this is a valid controller GUID the app will attempt to initialise it an add it to the list of available controllers.


Program start arguments
-----------------------
If you want to have the game pre-selected, start the app like this for PCars: [full path]\CrewChiefV4.exe PCARS_64BIT. Or use R3E or PCARS_32BIT.
This can be used in conjunction with the launch_pcars / launch_raceroom / [game]_launch_exe / [game]_launch_params and run_immediately options to set crew chief up to start the game selected in the app launch argument, and start its own process. I'll provide examples of this approach soon. 


rFactor2 Stock Car Rules (SCR) plugin
-------------------------------------
rFactor 2 Stock Car Rules (SCR) are implemented as a plugin. The Shared Memory plugin which Crew Chief uses does not see the output of the SCR plugin, because rF2 (partially) isolates plugins from each other. In order to work around this issue the Shared Memory plugin has to load the SCR plugin and forward all rF2 calls to it.

Steps to enable Stock Car Rules in the Crew Chief:

 - Let Crew Chief update the rF2 Shared Memory plugin to the latest version by starting rF2 and CC once, then exit the game.
 - Make sure StockCarRules.dll "Enabled" is set to 0 (yes, disabled) in UserData\player\CustomPluginVariables.json. Do NOT Delete the plugin.
 - In UserData\player\CustomPluginVariables.json make sure SM plugin configuration looks like this:

 "rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll":{
    " Enabled":1,
    "DebugISIInternals":0,
    "DebugOutputLevel":0,
    "EnableStockCarRulesPlugin":1
}

The SCR plugin and the messages associated with stock car rules will be enabled automatically for vehicle classes which have useAmericanTerms = true in their definition (some built in classes will have this). You can also force it to be enabled for all classes by selecting the "Use American terms" option in the Preferences screen.


Pit exit position prediction
----------------------------
Version 4.9.3.0 adds rudamentary race and track position predictions for pit exit. This is based on a benchmark pitstop time which uses the time difference between your best lap's sector3 and sector1 times, and the corresponding times on your inlap & outlap.

Benchmark pit times can be measured during a practice session with the 'time this stop' / 'practice pitstop' / 'time this pitstop' / 'pitstop benchmark' voice command, or by pressing the "Pitstop prediction" button before make your practice stop. Do some hot laps to get a baseline laptime, then issue this after your 'box this lap' command, and do a full race-simulation pitstop. Maintain race pace on your outlap until you finish sector1. The app will calculate how much time you lost and use this when you pit in the race. If you don't measure your own benchmark pit time the app will measure the time your opponents lose due to pitting and use this instead - note that this means pit exit prediction data won't be available until after at least one of your opponents have completed a pitstop.

If the app has usable benchmark data and you request a pitstop *before you reach sector3*, it'll tell you where you should come out and what the traffic will be like when you hit sector3. You can also request this data at any time with the 'Where will be be after a stop?' / 'Estimate pit exit positions' / 'What will happen if I pit?', or by pressing the "Pitstop prediction" button during a race, even if you've not requested a pitstop (the app will derive its estimates on every lap regardless or whether you actually pit).

At the time of writing there's more work to be done here and some more features that may be added.


Known Issues Which Aren't Fixable
---------------------------------

Project Cars doesn't send opponent laptime data, so the app has to time their laps. In practice and qual sessions this is fairly reliable (because the app can use the time remaining in the session, sent by the game, for its 'clock' when timing). In race sessions with a fixed number of laps the app has nothing it can use as a clock to time the laps, so times them itself. This can lead to opponent lap / sector time inaccuracies if the player pauses the game (the app's clock is still running).


Joining a session part way through (practice or qualify session online) will result in the app having an incomplete set of data for opponent lap and sector times. In such cases the best opponent lap and sector data is inaccurate. For Project Cars, there's nothing I can do about this. The opponent lap and sector times aren't in the shared memory (the app has to time their laps), so the pace and sector delta reports may be inaccurate (they use the fastest lap completed while the app is running). For Raceroom we can get the fastest opponent lap time, but if this lap was completed before the app was running, the sectors within that lap aren't accessible. In this case the pace report will include the lap time delta, but there'll be no sector delta reports.

In both cases as soon as an opponent sets a faster lap, the app will have up to date best lap data so the pace and sector reports will be accurate and complete.


Project Cars doesn't send opponent car class data, so the app has to assume that all drivers in the race are in the same car class. For multiclass races, all pace and other reports will be relative to the overall leader / fastest car.


RaceRoom uses a 'slot_id' field to uniquely identify drivers in a race. However, this field doesn't really work properly (there are lots of issues with it), so the app has to use the driver's names. Driver names for AI driver are not unique. All the lap time and other data held for each driver is indexed by driver name so if a race has 2 or more drivers with the same name, the app will get things like lap and sector times wrong. This is only a problem racing the AI - be aware that if you have a car class with a limited number of unique AI drivers (Daytona Prototypes / German Nationals / Americal Nationals / Hill Climb Legends / etc), but select a field size greater than this, the app will do weird things.


RaceRoom doesn't have a pre-start procedure phase for offline races, and in the pre-start phase online ("Gridwalk") very little valid and accurate data is available.


Project Cars doesn't have a distinct pre-start procedure phase. I've added some more messages before the 'get ready' but there's a risk here that they might delay the 'get ready' message.


Detecting 'good' passes isn't really feasible. I've tried to limit the 'good pass' messages to overtakes that are reasonably 'secure', don't result in the other car slowing excessively, and don't involve the player going off-track. I can't, for example, tell the difference between a clean pass and a bump-and-run punt, so you might get congratulated for driving like a berk.


Updating the app
----------------
If a new version of the app is available the auto updater will prompt you to download it. This will download and run a new .msi installer - just point it at the existing install location and it'll update your old installation. It won't remove your existing sound pack or your settings.

If a new sound pack or driver names pack is available the appropriate Download button(s) will be enabled - these will download and unpack the updated sounds / driver names, then restart the application.

Donations
---------
I made this because I wanted to make it and I enjoy making stuff. Working with the various quirks, errors and omissions in the shared data which the games provide hasn't been much fun, but it's all part of the challenge. Having said that, there are many many hours of hard work invested in this.
If you use it and like it and it becomes a regular and positive part of your sim racing, I'd be grateful if you would consider making a small donation. If only to stop my wife from complaining at me.

My paypal address is jim.britton@yahoo.co.uk

Or you can use this to donate directly:

https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=LW33XFXP4DPZE

Would be great to recoup some of the investment in making this, but the most important thing is that the app is used 'in anger' and enjoyed as part of the sim racing experience. To this end, I'm always on the lookout for bug reports and feature suggestions.

One final point. If the app says "Jim is faster than you", let him through :)


Changelog
---------
Version 4.9.3.7: Added option to pause most messages in braking and cornering zones (sections of the track starting from heavy braking and ending with near-full throttle application) - this doesn't apply to spotter messages or other very high priority messages. It can be enabled and disabled with a button mapping ('Toggle delay messages on hard parts') or a voice command ('don't talk in the [corners/braking zones]' / 'no messages in the [corners/braking zones]', 'talk to me anywhere' / 'messages at any point'). The initial state is set with the 'Delay messages on hard parts' option. Note that this feature is disabled for ovals and later sections of very short tracks; added some basic message prioritisation - there's still more work to do here; prevent any further fragments of a message from playing if this message was interrupted; simplified pitstop benchmark process - you can now get a benchmark pitstop time without having to set a hot lap first (although you'll still need to set one after your stop to allow the app to work out the time loss); a few bug fixes

Version 4.9.3.6: Reduce size of 'personalisations' update pack (install this update before updating your personalisations); Much more accurate tyre life prediction using a non-linear curve fit of tyre wear data recorded for the current tyre set (assumes a tyre is worn out when it has 5% life left); added more info to the fuel status message - now includes fuel-to-end; allow spotter sounds to cancel other queued messages (disabled by default, enable with 'Spotter and responses block other messages' property - note this can sound strange when only the start or end sounds of a message play); a few minor tweaks; iRacing - fix white-flag message spam

Version 4.9.3.5: Fixed sound pack version check

Version 4.9.3.4: Changed how sound pack downloads are handled - should significantly reduce the size of sound pack updates; added property categories to make finding stuff easier; added opponent pit exit prediction warning - if the app thinks an opponent car will probably come out of the pits close to you (and it can read his driver name), you'll be warned about him; further opponent pit exit estimation improvements; some internal bug fixes

Version 4.9.3.3: Fixed opponent pit time calculation in pit strategy - app was incorrectly guessing the time an opponent car was in the pitlane; take mandatory pitstop status into account when deriving expected post-pit opponent positions (assume opponents who still haven't pitted will pit this lap if we're at the end of the pit window); Added and corrected a few car classes (pCars2, iRacing and R3E); iRacing - fixed some car class allocation issues

Version 4.9.3.2: Improved pit stop exit prediction when opponents are in the pitlane; Don't reset the fuel data when leaving the pits during a race, unless we've added fuel.

Version 4.9.3.1: Hotfix for pitstop prediction additions (see previous release notes). This fixes the wildly inaccurate pit stop time loss estimates reported by the pitstop benchmark process if you make the benchmark request too late in the lap (after you've entered the final sector)

Version 4.9.3.0: First cut of pit exit prediction - obtain a benchmark pit time in practice by making the 'time this stop' / 'practice pitstop' / 'time this pitstop' / 'pitstop benchmark' command or pressing the assigned "Pitstop prediction" button before your practice stop. The pit exit prediction will play automatically some time after requsting a stop, or if you make the 'Where will I be after a stop?' / 'Estimate pit exit positions' / 'What will happen if I pit?' command or press the "Pitstop prediction" button during a race (see 'Pit exit position prediction' section above); Disable cold brakes warnings for some car classes; R3E - detect if this and next laps are invalidated due to cut track in quali/practice; R3E - disable pit stall position messages in post race; R3E - improve cut track detection; R3E -  fix best lap time not announced during leaderboard challenge; AC - fix crashes due to unexpected timings reported by the game; Suppress crashes when using Naudio Input - (but please send us log file if you get exceptions in log); Fix issue where best lap time is lost if it is set after an invalid lap; Fix incorrect gaps announced if vehicles aren't within the same lap; Fix DRS messages announced incorrectly if opponent is pitting; Make 'half fuel' call play at exactly half fuel (was playing a bit too early); App wide bug fixes

Version 4.9.2.9: Allow pit countdown past session finish (for cooldown lap); Don't grumble about a stopped engine if the car is still moving; some additional checks to handle delayed opponent position data; iRacing - improve live position tracking; iRacing - improve retired vehicle detection; iRacing - race finish position improvements; iRacing - finishing position detection improvements; iRacing - reliability fixes; rF2 - suppress pit messages while in garage/monitor; AC - fixed crash bug on 2-sector tracks; R3E & pCars2 - use game-provided time gaps to car in front / behind (more accurate than derived gaps); R3E - DRS message accuracy improvements; R3E - removed auto-confirm pit macro and associated logic (no longer needed, and can cause some issues with pitstops); R3E - disable spotter in hotlap mode

Version 4.9.2.5: Added commands to check self pace, you can ask "how's my self gap" / "how's my personal pace" / "how's my delta best" to see how you're doing relative to your own best lap; iRacing - fixed pit stall countdown; iRacing - fix finish position reporting; iRacing - allow pit voice commands to be enabled or disabled ("Enable iRacing pit stop commands", default enabled). Disabling them removes them from the phrases the speech recognition engine listens for, potentially improving accuracy for other phrases as well as preventing false positives; added ability to specify if car class has speed limiter via "limiterAvailable" class field; rF2 - enable pit stall countdown (doesn't work on some tracks, disabled on ovals); rF2 - add option to force Rolling Start start type.

Version 4.9.2.4: Fixed incorrect car class data in R3E online practice and qualifying sessions; logging readability improvements; small AMS performance improvement; some code cleanup

Version 4.9.2.3: Hotfix for Assetto Corsa broken spotter

Version 4.9.2.2: AMS off-track warning tweak - make 'kerb' a legal surface to drive on (should make the warnings much less common); A few other AMS fixes; Half distance fuel calculation tweak to make it a little more conservative; iRacing workarounds for missing opponent data when cars aren't rendered by the game; A few other iRacing bug fixes; Some UI tweaks to fix tab ordering and add shortcut keys (underlined on the UI)

Version 4.9.2.1: Fixed missing fuel data in RF2; Added option to specify how much 'reserve' to add when doing fuel calculations (enable the "Enable tight fuel calculations" property and set the reserve amount with the "Additional fuel to finish the race" property); Fixed iRacing SoF calculation; Various minor tweaks

Version 4.9.2.0: New RF2 shared memory plugin with better performance; More work to fix iRacing crashes since switching to the faster parser; Reinstated an iRacing crash fix that got lost in a previous update; Added an option to fall back to a slower, safer session info parser method in iRacing (property 'iRacing faster parser'). If the app crashes for you, uncheck this option to use the slower parse method and please post your findings a debug log in our forums so we can track the issue down

Version 4.9.1.7: Added tyre temperature thresholds for some missing tyre types (including wets) - should fix incorrect temperature warnings on wets and some other tyres; Mapped player tyre type in pCars 2 (note this doesn't support mixed tyre types); Fixed an issue with iRacing driver swaps that caused log-spam and performance issues

Version 4.9.1.6: iRacing hotfix for crash in mapper

Version 4.9.1.5: More detailed error messages; pCars and pCars2 performance improvements; iRacing performance improvements; AC fixes for shorter tracks (2 sectors); Fixed inaccurate race position messages in iRacing 'checkered flag' phase; Some iRacing stability improvements; Use relative lap time difference when working out when to give multi-class warnings. This uses 2 new Properties - 'Multi-class slower car warning time' and 'Multi-class faster car warning time' - this is the approximate average amount of notice you want the app to give you when approaching a different class car; Added iRacing voice commands to get out of car ('get out') and get the average SoF ('what's the sof' / 'what is the strength of field'); For Assetto Corsa, only allow multi-class races if the number of unknown car models does not exceed property 'Max unknown car models in ACS multi-class races' (default 0) - this is necessary because Assetto doesn't expose proper class data. This prevents the app dividing participants into different classes unless the app recognises all the car models in the session

Version 4.9.1.4: Workaround for iRacing 'opponent pitting now' message spam

Version 4.9.1.3: Minor multi-class tweaks; Assume single class if all car classes in a race are unknown to the app (AC, rF2 and rF1 only); Added button to save console output to a file (in Documents/ CrewChiefV4/debug/); Some AC internal fixes; Don't give damage and tyre wear responses in iRacing; Added Lee spotter (in latest sound pack update)

Version 4.9.1.1: Major internal overhaul to fully support multiclass races - opponents and positions are now tracked correctly for the player's car class, the app doesn't make calls about opponent laptimes, pitting, and other stuff if they're not in the same class as the player; added multi-class specific messages for when you're lapping or being lapped by other classes; added multi-class specific voice commands "is the car ahead in my class", "is the car behind my class", "what class is the car ahead", :"what class is the car behind" and variations; more performance improvements; speculative fixes for driver swaps in iRacing; fixed 'enable driver names' flag being ignored for some messages; added optional pit box countdown (R3E and iRacing only, enable with property "pit_box_position_countdown"); rF2 improvements: improved rolling start detection and distance to safety car detection, in SCR mode Crew Chief now respects DoubleFileType value and will announce last FCY lap Frozen Order instructions correctly; added option to change left/right side tyres(iRacing only); modified R3E pit macros to take advantage of modify pit menu behaviour (should make the pit macros, particularly the auto-confirm pit actions, more reliable); retrieve gap ahead / gap behind as late as possible when playing gap messages to improve accuracy; made auto-refuel ("fuel to the end" macro in R3E and "pitstop fuel to the end" command in iRacing) a bit more conservative - more so at longer tracks

Version 4.9.0.7: Added messages for oil and fuel pressure warnings (iRacing only); Added messages for stalling the engine; Added messages when you crash very heavily - the app will ask if you're OK and, if you're using voice commands, wait for you to respond (this can be disabled with the "Enable crash messages" option in Properties); Only use start-line track temperature in pCARS to prevent the app calling local track temp variations; Allow multi-class support to be disabled ("Force single class" property) - useful if you're playing with 3rd party content that has incorrect car class IDs; More performance improvements; Prevent the app's windows being resized such that controls are no longer visible (this behaviour can be disabled by unchecking the "Force minimum window size" property)

Version 4.9.0.6: Don't play 'good pass' message in pCARS 2 if we've just collided with someone (might still need some tuning); some performance improvements; fixed issues with historical weather data being lost; pCARS 2 pit window fixes (again...); fixed missing DQ / DNF session end messages; fixed mid-point fuel report saying "fuel looks good" when it clearly isn't good

Version 4.9.0.5: Fixed 'box this lap' messages playing in pCARS2 even though the player had completed his mandatory stop; some pCARS2 off track warning tweaks; Reworked R3E opponent lap invalidation code - should prevent the app incorrectly invalidating opponent laps; speculative fix for session end being 1 lap too late for iRacing fixed number of lap races

Version 4.9.0.4: Added voice command to get and estimate of how much fuel is needed to finish the race - "how much fuel to the end" / "how much fuel do we need"; Added voice command to get an estimate of how long the tyres will last (in minutes for timed sessions, laps for fixed lap number sessions) - "how long will the tires last" / "how long on these tires" / "how long will these tires last"; Added check to prevent a stopped car triggering incident warnings repeatedly; Added ability to set pit fuel amount in iRacing - "pitstop fuel to the end" / "pitstop fuel to the end of the race" - and via a macro in R3E and pCARS2 - "fuel to the end" / "fuel to the end of the race". See the 'Advanced command macros' section of the help.txt file or http://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?263-Command-key-press-macros&p=2378&viewfull=1#post2378 for more info (please read the documentation before using this in R3E or pCARS2 as it requires the default in-game pit strategy to be configured in a particular way, and is quite fragile - use at your own risk); Immediately close the pit menu in R3E after running a macro if we're close to the pit entry (if the menu is left open when you cross the limiter line, the auto-confirm macro will fail); If sound pack downloads fail, retry with the other server.

Version 4.9.0.3: Don't make Assetto Corsa spotter calls when viewing replays; reworked some of the sector gap logic; derive opponent laptimes and sector 3 times in Raceroom instead of using data provided by the game as the data provided by the game are always 1 lap out of date; reduce frequency of repeated "the next car is..." messages

Version 4.9.0.2: Fixed some issues in pCARS 2 session end detection and pre-start message triggering; disable pcars2 spotter in pits; some minor performance improvements

Version 4.9.0.1: Hotfix to prevent some stock car rules messages triggering when they shouldn't; don't read lap times or gaps if we're under full course yellow; added possible track cut warning for pCars2

Version 4.9.0.0: Added support for rF2 StockCarRules plugin, CC will now announce Lucky Dog, Wave Around, EOLL messages. To enable make sure you enable the "Use American terms" option, disable StockCarRules plugin in rF2, and set "EnableStockCarRulesPlugin":1 for "rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll" - see the "rFactor2 Stock Car Rules (SCR) plugin" section above or  http://thecrewchief.org/showthread.php?407-How-to-enable-rF2-Stock-Car-Rules-in-Crew-Chief&p=2931&viewfull=1#post2931 for more details; Add option to disable pit state announcement during FCY in rF2 and rF1/AMS; Disable brake temp messages on ovals; fixed pit macros not working for some R3E players; prevent some messages playing when they're no longer relevant; some internal fixes

Version 4.8.3.2: Fixed AC plugin after game update - the app should ask if you want to update the plugin when you first launch it in AC mode; More fixes to the manual rolling start logic; iRacing session transition crash fix; some car class tweaks; added nAudio speech recognition code to allow voice recognition input device selection (enable with property "Use nAudio for speech recognition" - thanks to Daniel Nowak for this one); disable sector delta messages on ovals and use more generous spotter parameters

Version 4.8.3.1: Corrected some pCARS 2 track names that got changed in the last pCARS 2 patch; disable some irrelvant sounds when racing on ovals; work around for some missing spotter sounds; a few internal fixes

Version 4.8.3.0: Changed personalisations download process to reduce bandwidth use

Version 4.8.2.9: Fixed a serious regression in multi-class race position tracking

Version 4.8.2.8: Added more variety to race finish messages; make default R3E pit macro pause a while before closing menu; warn when an opponent car is exiting the pits; a few other minor bits and bobs

Version 4.8.2.7: Experimental support for double-file manual rolling starts (R3E, pCARS2 & AC only - enable with "Manual formation lap double-file start" property); fixed arrow keys and some other keys not being released when used in command macros; iRacing rally cross fixes; more Formula E battery tracking logic and messages; split some longer voice command responses so if you want to hear more, you have to ask ("more information" / "more info" / "clarify") - currently only implemented for Formula E battery messages, but will be extended. If you want all the information in a single long response without having to ask for clarification, enable "Verbose messages" property; added missing RF1 / AMS blue flag override ("Enable AMS / rF1 blue on slower" property); some internal fixes

Version 4.8.2.6: Fixed some nAudio bugs that meant the radio beeps were being sent to the wrong audio device; added Hong Kong track mappings (RF2 Formula E pack); fixed tyre temperature thresholds on some R3E car classes; added voice command to get player incident count ("how many incidents do I have" / "what's my incident count") and session incident limit ("what's the incident limit") - iRacing only; added voice command to get player licence ("what's my licence class") and iRating ("whats my iRating") - iRacing only; added voice command to get opponent licence ("what's [the guy in front's / the leader's / p10's / Bob's] licence class") and iRating ("what's [the guy in front's / the leader's / p10's / Bob's] iRating") - iRacing only; battery monitoring bug fixes

Version 4.8.2.5: Reworked battery status message (response to voice command/button command), added battery use increase/decrease detection; added pit stop related messages for pCARS2; some internal bug fixing; allow spotter sounds ("car left" etc) to have their volume scaled relative to the other voice messages (property "spotter_volume_boost")

Version 4.8.2.4: Added battery related logic for electric cars (RF2 Formula E)

Version 4.8.2.3: Fixed some performance issues when using nAudio playback; Some internal sound player rework and bug fixing; Added "TTS volume boost" - by default the TTS sounds are now played at 2x volume, which balances them better with the the other sounds; Added TTS trim start and trim end properties to remove silence from TTS sounds; Added "Only use TTS when there is no alternative" option. When set to 'true' (the default) the app will drop messages or use generic terms to refer to opponents when it doesn't have a driver name recording. It will use TTS for driver names only if the message is considered essential (when e.g. responding to "who's in front?" voice command). The recommended TTS configuration is now to enable TTS, set "Only use TTS when there is no alternative" to true, set "TTS volume boost" to 2, "Trim end of TTS sounds" to 600 and "Trim start of TTS sounds" to 100 - see 'Help and getting started' for more information; Allow iracing tyre pressure adjustment voice commands to be made in PSI (when property "iRacing tyre pressure adjustments in PSI" is true the app assumes you mean PSI); Fixed broken voice recognition for "who's ahead", "who's behind" and "who's leading" commands; Added Ross spotter to latest sound pack; Allow iRacing fuel to be added in gallons

Version 4.8.2.1: Work-around for R3E missing sector number updates when cars exit to pits (should fix a lot of inaccurate calls in practice and qualifying); fixed mute not working properly in nAudio mode; Simplified track landmark generation (see Help); Some internal bugfixes

Version 4.8.1.9: Improvements to speech recogntion accuracy; integrated nAudio library for sound playback which allows you to choose play back devices for messages and background sounds (disabled by default - enable this with the "Use nAudio for playback" option) - this also allows the app to play back at higher volumes; added lots of iRacing pit commands (see the voice commands section in Help); lots of iRacing bug fixes; added a new spotter (Micha - in the latest sound pack)

Version 4.8.1.7: Opponent to player delta bug fixes (all games); added macros for some iRacing black-box interactions; lots of iRacing fixes; added new Pace Notes feature for recording and playing back user-created pace notes (see Help); fixed arrow keys not working for macros; fixed a few minor lap time reporting issues

Version 4.8.1.5: Better UI handling of sound pack downloads (app should no longer appear to hang while unpacking sounds); Announce retired and DQ'ed drivers in RF2; Fixed stale driverID in iRacing; Minor bug fixes - Mark out laps as invalid in R3E (should prevent stale lap time calls at the end of an out lap), RF2 pre-lights and overtake messages and track landmark mapping getting lost on session restart, pCARS 2 pit exit messages;

Version 4.8.1.4: Better pruning of pCARS2 stale and duplicated opponent data in online sessions (hacks adapted from pCARS1 to work around bugs inherited from pCARS1); Added opponent retired and opponent disqualified messages (pCARS2 / R3E); Some bugfixes in R3E for invalid lap handling; R3E and pCARS2 car and track mapping fixes

Version 4.8.1.3: Fixed an issue in the speech recogniser where grammars were initialised multiple times, reducing recognition accuracy - this should make the recogniser work more reliably; Fixed an issue in R3E and AC where a lap invalidated in sector 3 could cause stale best-lap data to be announced; Remove opponents who are reported as DNF / DQ / DNS in R3E; Added experimental option 'Disable alternative voice commands' (disabled by default). Enabling this will force the speech recogniser to only load the first command from each row in speech_recognition_config.txt. Instead of recognising any of "who's leading", "who's in the lead", "who is leading", "who is in the lead", or "who's the leader" the app will only recognise the first in the list - "who's leading". This will limit the number of phrases the recogniser understands and *may* improve recognition accuracy

Version 4.8.1.2: More iRacing bug fixes, mostly around session state tracking; Improved default pCARS2 command macros (massive thanks to Belaki on the pCARS forums); fixed pCARS2 pit window end message playing when it shouldn't; Added more tyre wear messages; RF2 bug fixes; Added overall damage report - triggered by voice command ("damage report / how's my car / is my car ok") or button assignment;Added session status report (race time remaining, pit status, gaps etc) - triggered by voice command ("session status / race status") or button assignment;Added car status report (damage, fuel, tyres etc) - triggered by voice command ("car status") or button assignment;Added combined status status report (session status + car status report) - triggered by voice command ("full update / full status / update me") or button assignment; Added a few more messages

Version 4.8.1.1: Corrected and added some corner mappings; Added function to read corner mappings for the current lap (activated with a button assignment or voice command "read corner names" / "corner names" / "tell me the corner names"); More iRacing beta updates; Tweaked overtake message probability

Version 4.8.1.0: iRacing beta; PCars2 beta (shared memory only - UDP isn't ready); Pit command macros beta (example implementations for R3E and pCARS2 included - see the "Command macros" section at the end of the Help file, and saved_command_macros.json in the app's installation folder); fixed lap time issues in AC (caused by the laptime not being sent to the app at the same time as the new-lap notification); extended support for RF2 StockCar rules plugin; more car class and track mapping data; RF2 opponent pit detection and additional pit messages; Mute the background sound when you talk to the chief; Block all messages when you're talking to the chief (optional - use property "Block messages when talking to the Chief"); lots and lots of bugfixes for RF2, PCars, AC and R3E; Attempt to predict when it might rain for PCars and PCars2 (enabled by default, use property "Enable PCars rain prediction using CloudBrightness" to disable). Note this uses changes in reported CloudBrightness value and is quite inaccurate

Version 4.8.0.7: RF2 fixes - fixed low fuel message playing when it shouldn't, fixed European versions of full course yellow messages not playing on new installs

Version 4.8.0.6: RF2 DRS support; RF2 full-course-yellow, standing start and rolling start order messages; R3E opponent laptime validation fix; don't play aero damage if the rest of the car is knackered; some AC fixes; Fixed first lap out of pits massively skewing fuel consumption estimate

Version 4.8.0.3: RF2 session transition fixes

Version 4.8.0.2: Fixed broken PCars2 oval track mapping - should now correctly call 'car low' / 'car high' on ovals for all spotters except Geoffrey

Version 4.8.0.1: Added some Project Cars 2 stuff - game type, launch options, and a couple of initial track mappings; fixed some incorrect tyre temperature warnings

Version 4.8.0.0: Updated Assetto Corsa plugin to be compatible with latest AC update; Added "Block messages when talking to the chief" option - this prevents any messages being played while you're making a voice command; Some fuel consumption calculation fixes.

Version 4.7.9.9: R3E 64Bit support; Added voice command to tell you (once the data is availalbe) what the relative performance difference is between different tyre types based on the best lap in the session for tyre type - e.g. "Softs are about 0.4 seconds faster than Mediums, Mediums are about 1.2 seconds faster than Hards". The voice command is "Give me tyre pace differences", "What are the tire speeds?" / "Whats the difference between tires?" / "Compare tire compounds" (R3E and RF2 only); Added opponent tyre type info when they leave the pits after changing tyre type (R3E and RF2 only).

Version 4.7.9.7: More RF2 race end detection fixes; Added Imola corner mappings for R3E; fixed race start message being repeated on manual rolling starts; some additional checks to prevent mandatory pitstop messages playing during or after you've completed your stop.

Version 4.7.9.5: Compatibility fixes for new Raceroom shared memory layout; Map to new Raceroom tyre types - you can ask "what tyres is [opponent name] on?", or "what tyres am I on?"

Version 4.7.9.4: Better sound pack update mechanism - wastes less bandwidth; Added "minimise to tray" and "start minimised" options. Minimise to tray places a Crew Chief icon in the system-tray when you minimise the app, with a right-click menu contain commonly used functions. The app can be started minimised if desired; Only allow manual formation lap mode to supress messages in race sessions (fixes missing messages in practice & qual with manual formation lap mode enabled); Fixed session end detection in RF2 / AMS / RF1 - the app should also detect when you click 'next session' without clicking 'end session' first; Added a new fuel calculation command ("calculate fuel for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel do i need for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / "how much fuel for [x] [laps / minutes / hours]" / ) - for example, "how much fuel do I need for twenty minutes?". Assuming the app's had the chance to record your fuel usage over at least one lap (the more the better), it'll estimate how much fuel you'll need for the requested number of laps / time based on your average consumption. IMPORTANT: if you use this to set your fuel load in a timed race you MUST add extra fuel to account for the lap you need to finish after the race timer reaches zero. The app WILL NOT DO THIS FOR YOU - if you put in exactly 20 minutes worth of fuel for a 20 minute race you'll run out on the last lap; Fixed some issues in the fuel use tracking logic.

Version 4.7.9.0: Fixed initialisation errors in TTS engine which prevented the app from starting when "Use TTS for missing names" was enabled; added option to select where the race starts on a manual formation lap - "Manual formation 'go' when leader crosses line". If this is true (the default) the app assumes that the race starts and cars are allowed to overtake as soon as the leader crosses the start line. If it's false, the app assumes that no one is allowed to overtake until they cross the start line; Added some RF1 session identifier fixes - should correct a few issues caused by the app thinking the race was actually qualifying.

Version 4.7.8.9: Fix for some settings getting corrupted on system which use a comma as a decimal separator - this causes some spotter and voice recognition issues. If you have already encountered this, please reload the app's default settings; Some fuel use calculation fixes; Spotter fixes; Added manual formation lap support. This supresses most messages on lap 1 and plays an alternate sequence of start messages - it assumes you're not allow to pass until you cross the start line. This mode can be activated and deactivated with a button press ("Toggle manual formation lap mode") or a voice command (enable with "this is the formation lap" / "formation lap" / "rolling start", disable with "standing start" / "no formation lap").

Version 4.7.8.6: Added optional radio beeps for when the spotter or the Chief interrupt each other. "Insert beep-out between Spotter and Chief" plays the close-channel beep after the chief / spotter has finished, and "Insert beep-in between Spotter and Chief" (the default) plays the open-channel beep before the chief / spotter interrupts. The spotter and chief use different beep sounds here, and these options can be combined if you want 2 beeps (close then open) when interrupting; Attempt to delete corrupted settings and force the app to restart if they can't be processed; Don't play fuel consumption estimate if it's 0 litres per lap

Version 4.7.8.1: RF2 plugin fixes for car damage issues in online races
	
Version 4.7.8.0: Fixed spotter logic where it would consider 2 cars along side to be "3 side", even if those cars were one behind the other; Use oval spotter messages (inside / outside) when on known oval tracks, if the selected spotter has these sounds; Tweaked spotter enable / disable sound to be a bit more appropriate for non-default spotter voice packs; Fixed broken sector 3 time deltas in Project Cars

Version 4.7.7.9: Fixed Assetto Corsa pit window open calculation for sessions with a fixed number of laps; Fixed a crash bug when starting the app with no sound pack
	
Version 4.7.7.8: Added dropdown to main screen to allow a different spotter voice to be selected; Added Geoffrey Lessel's awesome spotter sounds - these are in the latest sound pack. Select "Geoffrey" from the new 'Spotter voice pack' menu; Fixed a couple more spotter bugs; Added button binding to get fuel status (consumption and fuel remaining). The "how's my fuel?" voice command now reports the consumption as well as the remaining fuel

Version 4.7.7.5: More Scoops-Brand RF2 corner mappings; Fixed some spotter bugs; Added searching to Properties screen to make it a little less user-hostile; Replaced the nasty underscore_property_names with proper names on the Properties screen

Version 4.7.7.4: Substantial RF2 plugin rewrite; Attempt to map game data if we detect the PCars2 exe - this does (apparently) work but expect some bugs and issues; Ported some fixes from the PCars Android app - some free practice session improvements, more aggressive pruning of broken driver data, better (hopefully...) method of identifying player's data so monitoring other drivers shouldn't confuse the app.

Version 4.6.7.2: Use game-provided mandatory pitstop data where available (should fix app thinking you've completed your mandatory pitstop when the game thinks otherwise); Some more car and track mappings from Scoops; Added 'three wide you're on the left' and 'three wide you're on the right' to the spotter - optional, disabled by default (spotter_enable_three_wide_left_and_right in the Properties screen); Added voice command to get info about the car in front / behind is slower / faster than you - "where should I attack" / "where am I faster" / "where can I attack" or "where should I defend" / "where am I slower" / "where is he faster" / "where will he attack"; A few bug fixes; mapped Watkins Glen for PCars; Added fuel use per lap response - "what's my fuel usage" / "what's my fuel consumption" / "what's my fuel use".

Version 4.6.6.4: Overhauled internal sound handling to make the app behave better; Faster start up times; Better CPU usage; some internal fixes; more of Scoop's corner mappings (recordings still to be done)

Version 4.6.6.2: Fixed some RFactor and RFactor2 issue; Added a few more track location mappings (thanks again Scoops); Disabled 'incident ahead' in R3E while I resolve the false-positives

Version 4.6.6.1: Added a big set of corner name and location data thanks to Scoops' hard work; Overhauled yellow flag logic for sector yellows and local yellows; Read times accurate to hundredths of a second in some circumstances; added oval-specific behaviours (enabled per-track with a flag in trackLandmarks.json) - ignores brake and left side tyre temps, estimates tyre wear from right side tyres only; added an experimental 'realistic mode' option - enabling this supresses some messages based on car class and track (e.g. spotter is off at start of session when not on ovals, older car classes have less telemetry based info like tyre temps) - this is very much 'work in progress'; added per-car class behaviours for yellow flag phrasing (e.g. pace car vs safety car) and last lap message (e.g. "white flag" for last lap only applies to Indy and NASCAR cars); Added 'force update check' button.

Version 4.6.5.2: Fixed AC plugin after 1.14 update.

Version 4.6.5.1: Fixed a silly bug in the legacy R3E blue flag detection (used when flag rules are disabled).

Version 4.6.5.0: Automatically switch between yellow and blue flag implementations in R3E depending on whether flag rules are enabled in-game; Added some more incident calling and yellow flag options; Added button mapping and voice command to suspend and enable yellow flag messages - enable with "give me yellows", "tell me yellows", "give me incident updates" or "give me yellow flag updates". Disable with "no more yellows", "stop incident updates", "don't give me yellows" or "don't tell me yellows"; Fixed the "where is Bob?" voice message response in qual and practice sessions

Version 4.6.4.9: Added R3E Mantorp Park (long), Norisring and Sachsenring corner data; A bit more R3E flag tweaking

Version 4.6.4.8: Skip 'dead' opponent data copies coming from PCars (should fix a few issues with inaccurate opponent data); Added R3E Hungaroring corner data; Made opponent incident detection less sensitive and added an option to disable it (enable_simple_incident_detection); Reworked opponent lap and sector handling to fix incorrect sector time and pace reports (all games); Tweaked R3E yellow flag reporting to allow status changes to settle before reporting
	
Version 4.6.4.7: A few minor bug fixes

Version 4.6.4.6: Some more Raceroom flag calling tweaks - should be less noisy but may miss rapidly changing flag situations; Added RF2 'stock car' mode (sound recordings to follow);Added R3E Nurburgring GP corner data

Version 4.6.4.5: Some Raceroom flag calling tweaks

Version 4.6.4.4: Initial support for Raceroom yellow flag implementation and revised shared memory layout; a few minor bug fixes

Version 4.6.4.2: Delay lead change messages slightly and validate before playing; fixed potential error when working out where a pileup has occurred 

Version 4.6.4.1: Fix crash bug in PCars with UDP data

Version 4.6.4.0: Added installer for game specific plugins (AC, AMS / RF1 and RF2) - the app now offers to copy the required plugin files to the games' install directory if they're missing or out of date; extended incident reporting logic and sounds to allow for multiple involved drivers to be reported (if we have the driver name sounds) or 'pileup' warning if 4 or more drivers are stopped in the same corner; added more corner landmarks; opponent tracking fixes for PCars; loads and loads of bugfixes and improvements

Version 4.6.3.2: Temporary hack to reduce wheel locking sensitivity - hopefully will prevent false-positives while I work out a better algorithm

Version 4.6.3.1: Temporary hack to reduce wheel spin sensitivity - hopefully will prevent false-positives while I work out a better algorithm; fixed Assetto Corsa pit window calls being 1 lap out

Version 4.6.3.0: New Python module for Assetto Corsa - please replace your existing ...\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python\CrewChiefEx\ folder with the new one in the app's install folder; New plugin for RF2 - please replace your existing ...\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor2\Bin64\Plugins\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll with the new one in the app's install folder; Added corner names to some calls on several tracks (this is will a work-in-progress); Revised RF2 and AMS opponent data handling to fix missing gap messages; More work on AMS session end bugs; Added better reporting of yellow flags for AMS and RF2 - the app will sometimes tell you who's involved in the incident and what corner the incident is in; Added simple incident reporting for known corners in R3E, AC and PCars; Added attack / defend calls for known corners (note these messages don't play often - this is intentional); Added brake locking and wheel spin reporting for known corners; RF2 timing accuracy improvements; Added Assetto Corsa damage reporting; Lots of minor bugfixes and improvements

Version 4.6.1.5: Fixed AMS multi-class support and added some AMS car classes; Corrected AMS session end logic - should prevent session end messages playing until you complete your lap; Reworked AMS opponent lap time handlingdon't play 'chequered flag' message in race sessions; fixed messages not playing in unlimited timed sessions; some bug fixes

Version 4.6.1.4: Fixed PCars timed sessions

Version 4.6.1.3: Fixed broken personalisations (oops)

Version 4.6.1.2: Fixed broken settings preventing changes to any setting from being saved

Version 4.6.1.1: Integrated personalisations - the app will ask you to download a new "Personalisations" sound pack. When this is complete the "My name" drop down box (top right) has a long list of names the app can use when addressing you. This replaces the old method of manually unpacking a prefixes_and_suffixes folder to the app's sounds; Work-around for Assetto Corsa sometimes giving out of date position information; Disable multi-class code for RF1 based games because the vehicle type data from Automobilista is too vague (things like "Ford" and "Peugeot"); Ported RF2 full course yellow and sector-specific yellow flag announcements to Automobilista; Removed irrelvant pit window messages from RF1 based sims - in offline sessions, if a pit schedule is defined the app will call "box now" in accordance with this schedule (assuming equal stint lengths) - this can be disabled with enable_ams_pit_schedule_messages property;Fixed cut track warnings playing on out laps in Automobilista

Version 4.6.0.5: Major overhaul of time reading (English sound pack - users of the Italian sound pack are unaffected); added RF2 caution period and yellow flag events; scan for controllers only on request (press the "Scan for controllers" button to update the app's list of controllers) - this also improves the app's startup time; fixed Assetto Corsa missing race start after 1.12 patch; added chequered flag message for timed sessions (still some issues here with PCars); reworked PCars session end detection; added controller bindings for message volume up / down; added some simple help text (much much more needs to be added to this); externalised car class definitions (first version - lots more work to do here); lots of bug fixes

Version 4.5.0.0: First cut of RF2 support, thanks to The Iron Wolf. This needs an additional .dll plugin for RF2 - see https://forum.studio-397.com/index.php?threads/crew-chief-v4-5-with-rfactor-2-support.54421/ Updated some Raceroom car classes

Version 4.4.3.4: Some controller cleanup tweaks

Version 4.4.3.3: R3E patch update

Version 4.4.2.4: Fixed controllers initialisation bug which should fix very slow (2-3 minutes) startup time for some users - thanks Tako.

Version 4.4.2.3: Removed some debug calls

Version 4.4.2.2: Only cancel pre-lights messages on throttle application; Added option to disable yellow flags in Assetto Corsa, and made them a little less frequent; Some Assetto Corsa opponent position fixes

Version 4.4.2.1: Fixed some issues with pre-lights messages

Version 4.4.2.0: Reworked pre-lights message logic (optional) - app will play race session messages while you're on the grid until the throttle / brake / clutch is pressed, then it'll play the 'get ready' message. This can be enabled by selecting 'play_pre_lights_messages_until_cancelled' option on the Properties screen; Some driver name mapping fixes.

Version 4.4.1.3: Added more tyres for Assetto Corsa; fixed missing 'standby' response delay; reduced pre-lights message queue length; some Italian translation support fixes.

Version 4.4.1.2: "How are my tyre temps" and "How are my brake temps" now give the status (hold / good / cold) rather than the actual temps.

Version 4.4.1.1: Fixed AC spotter being disabled at the start of each lap; Fixed crash when selecting AC as the game type if the previous game type was AMS; Started wiring up AC tyre wear / temp data (just GT3 class so far).

Version 4.2.1.8: Include more laps in the opponent vs player laptime comparisons during race sessions

Version 4.2.1.7: Use lastSectorTime data for opponent cars when in PCars UDP (network data) mode. This makes the opponent lap time reports accurate as the app doesn't have to time them itself (this data isn't available in PCars shared memory data)

This should also prevent the app from removing cached laptime data (which results in inaccurate 'best lap' messages).

Version 4.1.4.4: More pit window logic fixes for PCars; don't play pre-lights messages in PCars when the race is a fixed time.

Version 4.1.4.3: Fixed 'box this lap' calls being made when there is no mandatory stop, when running PCars in UDP mode.

Version 4.1.4.2: Fixed some speech recogniser / button handling issues - "Toggle" mode is now renamed "Press and release button" and actually works; Read the sector times response as a single message per sector, to allow interrupting and fix an issue with the Italian number reader.

Version 4.1.0.2: Renamed UDP network button data option to make it clearer that this takes button presses from the UDP stream, rather than from the device directly

Version 4.1.0.1: More internal fixes to the radio channel handling logic to handle a couple of edge-cases where it wasn't closing the channel promptly; Spotter performance and latency improvements; Spotter logic fixes for cases where a '3 wide' turns into a 'car left' / 'car right'; Don't attempt to update and load a new driver name for an existing player if the new name isn't valid / usable; Tyre temp range tweaks; Check messages for validity and timeout just before playing them; Use separate class for each PCars Road car class; Handle broken PCars string data which had null characters in the middle of the String; PCars car class handling improvements

Version 4.0.3.4: Internal rework for Project Cars to handle String data which occasionally starts with a null character. Should fix 'missing' opponents and incorrect car classes

Version 4.0.3.3: Major spotter overhaul - changed the way app calculates opponent speeds, much more accurate. Should make a difference to the ghost calls
